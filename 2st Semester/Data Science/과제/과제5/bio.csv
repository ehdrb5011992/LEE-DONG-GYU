regularity in the galaxy one-dimensional polar distribution with a
characteristic scale of 128 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. This aparent spatial periodicity can
be naturally explained by a time oscillation of the gravitational constant $G$.
On the other hand, periodic growth features of bivalve and coral fossiles
appear to show a periodic component in the time dependence of the number of
days per year. In this letter we show that a time oscillating gravitational
constant with similar period and amplitude can explain such a feature.

physics, chemistry, biology, systems engineering, and other areas. The problem
is well understood when the underlying dynamics of the system obey detailed
balance. When this assumption fails many of the results of classical
transition-rate theory no longer apply, and no general method exists for
computing the weak-noise asymptotics of fundamental quantities such as the mean
escape time. In this paper we present a general technique for analysing the
weak-noise limit of a wide range of stochastically perturbed continuous-time
nonlinear dynamical systems. We simplify the original problem, which involves
solving a partial differential equation, into one in which only ordinary
differential equations need be solved. This allows us to resolve some old
issues for the case when detailed balance holds. When it does not hold, we show
how the formula for the mean escape time asymptotics depends on the dynamics of
the system along the most probable escape path. We also present new results on
short-time behavior and discuss the possibility of focusing along the escape
path.

  Trial-and-Error","  Neural network models offer a theoretical testbed for the study of learning
at the cellular level. The only experimentally verified learning rule, Hebb's
rule, is extremely limited in its ability to train networks to perform complex
tasks. An identified cellular mechanism responsible for Hebbian-type long-term
potentiation, the NMDA receptor, is highly versatile. Its function and efficacy
are modulated by a wide variety of compounds and conditions and are likely to
be directed by non-local phenomena. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that
NMDA receptors are not essential for some types of learning. We have shown that
another neural network learning rule, the chemotaxis algorithm, is
theoretically much more powerful than Hebb's rule and is consistent with
experimental data. A biased random-walk in synaptic weight space is a learning
rule immanent in nervous activity and may account for some types of learning --
notably the acquisition of skilled movement.

(VF), spatial correlation functions and their characteristic lengths were
estimated from epicardial electrograms of pigs in VF. The correlation length of
the VF in pigs was found to be approximately 4-10 mm, varying as fibrillation
progressed. The degree of correlation decreased in the first 4 seconds after
fibrillation then increased over the next minute. The correlation length is
much smaller than the scale of the heart, suggesting that many independent
regions of activity exist on the epicardium at any one time. On the other hand,
the correlation length is 4 to 10 times the interelectrode spacing, indicating
that some coherence is present. These results imply that the heart behaves
during VF as a high-dimensional, but not random, system involving many spatial
degrees of freedom, which may explain the lack of convergence of fractal
dimension estimates reported in the literature. Changes in the correlation
length also suggest that VF reorganizes slightly in the first minute after an
initial breakdown in structure.

to show three successive stages with the growth of the number of cells;
coherent growth, dynamic clustering, and fixed cell differentiation. At the
last stage, disparity in activities, germ line segregation, somatic cell
differentiation, and homeochaotic stability against external perturbation are
found. Our results, in consistency with the experiments of the preceding paper,

novel and general scenario for systems with growing numbers of elements, also

synchronization by chaotic instability. Relevance of the clustering to
ecological, immune, neural, and cellular networks is discussed, with the
emphasis of partially ordered states with chaotic itinerancy. First, clustering
with bit structures in a hypercubic lattice is studied. Spontaneous formation
and destruction of relevant bits are found, which give self-organizing, and
chaotic genetic algorithms. When spontaneous changes of effective couplings are
introduced, chaotic itinerancy of clusterings is widely seen through a feedback
mechanism, which supports dynamic stability allowing for complexity and
diversity, known as homeochaos. Second, synaptic dynamics of couplings is
studied in relation with neural dynamics. The clustering structure is formed
with a balance between external inputs and internal dynamics. Last, an
extension allowing for the growth of the number of elements is given, in
connection with cell differentiation. Effective time sharing system of
resources is formed in partially ordered states.

and maintenance of diversity and complexity. Evolution to the edge of chaos is
demonstrated in an imitation game. As an origin of diversity, dynamic
clustering of identical chaotic elements, globally coupled each to other, is
briefly reviewed. The clustering is extended to nonlinear dynamics on
hypercubic lattices, which enables us to construct a self-organizing genetic
algorithm. A mechanism of maintenance of diversity, ``homeochaos"", is given in
an ecological system with interaction among many species. Homeochaos provides a
dynamic stability sustained by high-dimensional weak chaos. A novel mechanism
of cell differentiation is presented, based on dynamic clustering. Here, a new
concept -- ``open chaos"" -- is proposed for the instability in a dynamical
system with growing degrees of freedom. It is suggested that studies based on
interacting chaotic elements can replace both top-down and bottom-up
approaches.

many cases the performance of the nervous system is so good that it apporaches
fundamental physical limits, such as the limits imposed by diffraction and
photon shot noise in vision. In this paper we show how to use the language of
statistical field theory to address and solve problems in signal processing,
that is problems in which one must estimate some aspect of the environment from
the data in an array of sensors. In the field theory formulation the optimal
estimator can be written as an expectation value in an ensemble where the input
data act as external field. Problems at low signal-to-noise ratio can be solved
in perturbation theory, while high signal-to-noise ratios are treated with a
saddle-point approximation. These ideas are illustrated in detail by an example
of visual motion estimation which is chosen to model a problem solved by the
fly's brain. In this problem the optimal estimator has a rich structure,
adapting to various parameters of the environment such as the mean-square
contrast and the correlation time of contrast fluctuations. This structure is
in qualitative accord with existing measurements on motion sensitive neurons in
the fly's brain, and we argue that the adaptive properties of the optimal
estimator may help resolve conlficts among different interpretations of these
data. Finally we propose some crucial direct tests of the adaptive behavior.

Here we compute several Laplace inversions from different thermal scenarios,
both analytically and numerically, to test the efficiency of the method.
Especially the case of a two component structure, related to a possible first
order phase transition to a quark gluon plasma, is closer investigated and it
is shown that at least a signal to noise ratio of $10^4$ is necessary to
resolve two individual components.

phenomena underlying microscopic dynamics of proteins. Many experiments
performed in the 1980s have demonstrated that within the protein native state,
apart from usual vibrational dynamics, a rich interconformational (activated)
dynamics exists. The slowness of this dynamics makes any conventional theory of
chemical reactions inapplicable for description of enzymatic reactions. It is
presumably a rule that it is the process of conformational relaxation, and not
the details of chemical mechanism, that affects their rate. In a simple model
of Protein-Machine type, applied in constructing a novel theory of enzymatic
reaction, conformational dynamics is treated as a realative quasi-continuous
motion of solid-like structural elements of protein. Simple and tractable
formulas for the chemical relaxation time and the enzyme turnover number in the
steady state conditions are found. The important result obtained is that the
kinetic mechanisms close to and far from the equilibrium can differ.

analyzing a simple deterministic equation. It is found that a sequence of
abrupt changes of populations punctuating quiescent states characterize the
long time behavior. An asymptotic analysis is developed by introducing a
log-scaled time, and it is shown that such a dynamical process behaves as
non-steady weak chaos in which population disturbances grow algebraically in
time. Also, some relevance of our study to taxonomic data of biological
extinction is mentioned.

environmental stresses such as harsh climates and so are more easily rendered
extinct. Results of simulations and analytic calculations using our model show
a power-law distribution of extinction sizes which is in reasonable agreement
with fossil data. e also see a number of features qualitatively similar to
those seen in the fossil record. For example, we see frequent smaller
extinctions in the wake of a large mass extinction, which arise because there
is reduced competition for resources in the aftermath of a large extinction
event, so that species which would not normally be able to compete can get a
foothold, but only until the next cold winter or bad attack of the flu comes
along to wipe them out.

schemes which we call ``random $k$-sets designs''. In these designs, the pools
in which any clone occurs are equally likely to be any possible selection of
$k$ from the $v$ pools. The values of $k$ and $v$ can be chosen to optimize
desirable properties. Random $k$-sets designs have substantial advantages over
alternative pooling schemes: they are efficient, flexible, easy to specify,
require fewer pools, and have error-correcting and error-detecting
capabilities. In addition, screening can often be achieved in only one pass,
thus facilitating automation. For design comparison, we assume a binomial
distribution for the number of ``positive'' clones, with parameters $n$, the
number of clones, and $c$, the coverage. We propose the expected number of {\em
resolved positive} clones---clones which are definitely positive based upon the
pool assays---as a criterion for the efficiency of a pooling design. We
determine the value of $k$ which is optimal, with respect to this criterion, as
a function of $v$, $n$ and $c$. We also describe superior $k$-sets designs
called $k$-sets packing designs. As an illustration, we discuss a robotically
implemented design for a 2.5-fold-coverage, human chromosome 16 YAC library of
$n=1,298$ clones. We also estimate the probability each clone is positive,
given the pool-assay data and a model for experimental errors.

of sliplinks, obtained through the application of the Balian - Bloch -

reports a simple change and reinterpretation of the domain theory in terms of
M-of-N concepts, involving no learning, that results in an accuracy of 93.4% on
the 106 items of the database. Moreover, an exhaustive search of the space of
M-of-N domain theory interpretations indicates that the expected accuracy of a
randomly chosen interpretation is 76.5%, and that a maximum accuracy of 97.2%
is achieved in 12 cases. This demonstrates the informativeness of the domain
theory, without the complications of understanding the interactions between
various learning algorithms and the theory. In addition, our results help
characterize the difficulty of learning using the DNA promoters theory.

  and amphiphilic systems","  Dislocations in soft condensed matter systems such as lamellar systems of
polymers, liquid crystals and ternary mixtures of oil, water and surfactant
(amphiphilic systems) are described in the framework of continuum elastic
theory. These systems are the subject of studies of physics, chemistry and
biology. They also find applications in the industry. Here we will discuss in
detail the influence of dislocations on the bulk and surface properties of
these lamellar phases. Especially the latter properties have only been recently
studied in detail. We will present the experimental evidence of the existence
of screw and edge dislocations in the systems and study their static properties
such as: energy, line tension and core structure. Next we will show how does
the surface influence the equilibrium position of dislocations in the system.
We will give the theoretical predictions and present the experimental results
on thin copolymer films, free standing films of liquid crystals and smectic
droplets shapes. The surface is deformed by dislocations. These deformations
are known as edge profiles. Surface deformations induce elastic interactions
between edge dislocations. A new phenonenon discussed in our paper is the
fluctuations induced interactions between edge dislocations.At suitable
conditions edge dislocations can undergo an unbinding transition. Also a single
dislocation loop in a smectic freely suspended film can undergo an unbinding
transition. We shall also compute the equilibrium size of the loop contained
between two hard walls. Finally we will discuss the dynamical bulk properties
of dislocations such as: mobility (climb and glide),permeation, and helical
instability of screw dislocations. Lubrication theory will also be discussed.

natural languages. Although DNA is a presumably an ``organized system of
signs'' in Mandelbrot's (1961) sense, an observation of statistical features of
the sort presented in the Mantegna et al. paper does not shed light on the
similarity between DNA's ``grammar'' and natural language grammars, just as the
observation of exact Zipf-like behavior cannot distinguish between the
underlying processes of tossing an $M$ sided die or a finite-state branching
process.

systems, including magneto-elastic ribbons, lasers, chemical reactions,
arrhythmic cardiac tissue, and spontaneously bursting neuronal networks. An
underlying assumption in all of these studies is that the system being
controlled is chaotic. However, the identification of chaos in experimental
systems, particularly physiological systems, is a difficult and often
misleading task. Here we demonstrate that the chaos criteria used in a recent
study can falsely classify a noise-driven, non-chaotic neuronal model as being
chaotic. We apply chaos control, periodic pacing, and anticontrol to the
non-chaotic model and obtain results which are similar to those reported for
apparently chaotic, {\em in vitro} neuronal networks. We also obtain similar
results when we apply chaos control to a simple stochastic system. These novel
findings challenge the claim that the aforementioned neuronal networks were
chaotic and suggest that chaos control techniques can be applied to a wider
range of experimental systems than previously thought.

about almost identical cells with synchronized metabolic oscillations. As the
number is increased the oscillations lose the synchrony, leading to groups of
cells with different phases of oscillations. At later stage this
differentiation is fixed in time, and cells spilt into groups with different
chemical constituents spontaneously, which are transmitted to daughter cells by
cell divisions. Hierarchical differentiation, origin of stem cells, and

of objects L by asking subset queries of the form ``does the subset Q of L
contain a distinguished object?'' The primary biological application of group
testing is for screening libraries of clones with hybridization probes. This is
a crucial step in constructing physical maps and for finding genes. Group
testing has also been considered for sequencing by hybridization. Another
important application includes screening libraries of reagents for useful
chemically active zones. This preliminary report discusses some of the
constrained group testing problems which arise in biology.

pairings to each sequence, known as secondary structure. These preimages can be
constructed as random graphs (i.e. the neutral networks associated to the
structure $s$). By interpreting the secondary structure as biological
information we can formulate the so called Error Threshold of Shapes as an
extension of Eigen's et al. concept of an error threshold in the single peak
landscape. Analogue to the approach of Derrida & Peliti for a of the population
on the neutral network. On the one hand this model of a single shape landscape
allows the derivation of analytical results, on the other hand the concept
gives rise to study various scenarios by means of simulations, e.g. the
interaction of two different networks. It turns out that the intersection of
two sets of compatible sequences (with respect to the pair of secondary
structures) plays a key role in the search for ''fitter'' secondary structures.

rugged fitness landscape. Fixed fitness values for each possible genotype are
assigned randomly, with all fit individuals having the same probability of
reproduction. The previously observed transition to a self-organized state of
the population with less recombinational load, implies an abrupt change of
genetic overlap distributions, showing up characteristics of a phase
transition. A crossover variant of the model has a smoother transition to the
adapted regime, with a residual collective adaptation for small values of the
threshold in fitness. When a geographical constraint (shortest possible
distance) on pairwise reproduction in a population arranged one-dimensionally
is imposed, a poised state results, suggestive of self-organized criticality.

proposed theoretical schemes, this selection is modeled as ``minimal
frustration,'' or ``optimal energy'' of the desirable target conformation over
all possible sequences, such that the ``design'' of the sequence is governed by
the interactions between monomers. With replica mean field theory, we examine
the possibility to reconstruct the renaturation, or freezing transition, of the
``designed'' heteropolymer given the inevitable errors in the determination of
interaction energies, that is, the difference between sets (matrices) of
interactions governing chain design and conformations, respectively. We find
that the possibility of folding to the designed conformation is controlled by
the correlations of the elements of the design and renaturation interaction
matrices; unlike random heteropolymers, the ground state of designed
heteropolymers is sufficiently stable, such that even a substantial error in
the interaction energy should still yield correct renaturation.

  Folding","  We solve a model that takes into account entropic barriers, frustration, and
the organization of a protein-like molecule. For a chain of size $M$, there is
an effective folding transition to an ordered structure. Without frustration,
this state is reached in a time that scales as $M^{\lambda}$, with
$\lambda\simeq 3$. This scaling is limited by the amount of frustration which
leads to the dynamical selectivity of proteins: foldable proteins are limited
to $\sim 300$ monomers; and they are stable in {\it one} range of temperatures,
independent of size and structure. These predictions explain generic properties
of {\it in vivo} proteins.

  Reasoning","  Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular
biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we
discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal
reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for
representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for
determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding
one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two
important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a
backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop
techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly
optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable
and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically
improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously
suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time
and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the
techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems
that are of practical size.

The exact solution of the model shows that error catastrophe arises as a direct

adequate to properly describe evolution of complex life on the Earth.

to be the optimal folding temperature. The method was tested using monte-carlo
folding simulations of the designed sequences, at various folding temperatures
$T_{F}$. (Folding simulations were run on a cubic lattice for computational
convenience, but the design process itself is lattice-independent.) Simulations
confirmed that, over a wide range of $T_{Z}$, all designed sequences folded
rapidly when $T_{F} \approx T_{Z}$. Additionally, highly thermostable model
proteins were created simply by designing with high $T_{Z}$. The mechanism
proposed in these studies provides a plausible pathway for the evolutionary
design of biologically active proteins, which {\em must} fold and remain stable
within a relatively narrow range of temperatures.

on simulations of interacting cells with biochemical networks and cell division
process following consumption of some chemicals. According to the simulations
of the interaction-based dynamical systems model, the following scenario of the
cell differentiation is proposed. (1) Up to some threshold number, divisions
bring about almost identical cells with synchronized biochemical oscillations.
(2)As the number is increased the oscillations lose the synchrony, leading to
groups of cells with different phases of oscillations. (3)Amplitudes of
oscillation and averaged chemical compositions start to differ by groups of
cells. The differentiated behavior of states is transmitted to daughter cells.
(4)Recursivity is formed so that the daughter cells keep the identical chemical
character. This ``memory"" is made possible through the transfer of initial
conditions. (5) Successive differentiation proceeds. Mechanism of tumor cell
formation, origin of stem cells, anomalous differentiation by transplantations,
apoptosis and other features of cell differentiation process are also
discussed, with some novel predictions. (Keywords: differentiation, chemical

minimal frustration to the energy landscapes of random heteropolymers. The
resulting funnelled landscape exhibits both a phase transition from a molten

which together with a simple theory of collapse allows us to depict folding as
a double-well free energy surface in terms of suitable reaction coordinates.
Observed trends in barrier positions and heights with protein sequence length,
stability, and temperature are explained within the context of the model. We

non-additive hydrophobic forces. Denaturation curves similar to those seen in

  problem","  In this paper we introduce a novel method of deriving a pairwise potential
for protein folding. The potential is obtained by optimization procedure, which
simultaneously maximizes the energy gap for {\it all} proteins in the database.
To test our method and compare it with other knowledge-based approaches to
derive potentials, we use simple lattice model. In the framework of the lattice
model we build a database of model proteins by a) picking randomly 200 lattice
chain conformations; b) designing sequences which fold into these structures
with some arbitrary ``true'' potential; c) use this database for extracting a
potential; d) fold model proteins using the extracted potential. This test on
the model system showed that our procedure is able to recover the potential
with correlation $r \approx 91\%$ with the ``true'' one and we were able to
fold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical
knowledge-based approaches were tested using lattice models and the results
indicate that they also can recover the ``true'' potential with high degree of
accuracy. When applied to real protein structures with energy function taken in
contact pairwise approximation, our potential scored somewhat better than
existing ones. However, the discrimination of the native structure from decoys
is still not strong enough to make the potential useful for {\em ab initio}
folding. We argue that more detail of protein structure and energetics should
be taken into account to achieve better energy gaps. The suggested method is
general to allow to systematically derive parameters for more sophisticated
energy function. The internal control of validity of the potential derived by
our method, is converegency to a unique solution upon addition of new proteins

properties that determine folding to the native state. The protein chain is
modeled as a sequence of $N$ beads. The interactions between beads are taken
from a Gaussian distribution of energies. We studied 56 sequences with unique
ground states for $N = 15$ and $27$. Thermodynamic and kinetic properties were
determined using Monte Carlo simulations and exhaustive enumeration. For all
sequences we find collapse temperature, $T_{\theta}$, at which the protein
collapses into compact structure, and folding temperature, $T_{f}$, at which
the protein acquires the native state. We show that parameter $\sigma =
(T_{\theta} - T_{f})/T_{\theta}$ correlates extremely well with folding times.
Fast folders reach the native state via a nucleation collapse mechanism without
forming any intermediates, whereas for moderate and slow folders only a
fraction of molecules $\Phi $ reaches the native state by this process. The
remaining fraction folds via three stage multipathway process. The simultaneous
requirement of native state stability and kinetic accessibility can be achieved
for the sequences with small values of $\sigma $.

times, $\tau _{F}$, and $\sigma = (T_{\theta } - T_{F})/T_{\theta } $, where
$T_{\theta }$ and $T_{F}$ are the equilibrium collapse and folding transition
temperatures, respectively. The microscopic dynamics reveals several scenarios
for the refolding kinetics depending on the values of $\sigma $. Proteins with
small $\sigma $ reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapse
mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by single dominant native
basin of attraction. Proteins with large $\sigma $ get trapped in competing
basins of attraction, in which they adopt misfolded structures. In this case
only a small fraction of molecules $\Phi $ access the native state rapidly, the
majority of them approach the native state by a three stage multipathway
mechanism. The partition factor $\Phi $ is determined by $\sigma $: smaller the
value of $\sigma $ larger is $\Phi $. The qualitative aspects of our results
are found to be independent of the friction coefficient. Estimates for time

studied for 2-D and 3-D lattice Boltzmann BGK models (LBGK) and a new method to
specify these conditions are proposed. These conditions are constructed in
consistency of the wall boundary condition based on an idea of bounceback of
non-equilibrium distribution. When these conditions are used together with the
improved incompressible LBGK model by Zou et al., the simulation results
recover the analytical solution of the plane Poiseuille flow driven by pressure
(density) difference with machine accuracy. Since the half-way wall bounceback
boundary condition is very easy to implement and was shown theoretically to
give second-order accuracy for the 2-D Poiseuille flow with forcing, it is used
with pressure (density) inlet/outlet conditions proposed in this paper and in
Chen et al. to study the 2-D Poiseuille flow and the 3-D square duct flow. The
numerical results are approximately second-order accurate. The magnitude of the
error of the half-way wall bounceback is comparable with that using some other
published boundary conditions. Besides, the bounceback condition has a much
better stability behavior than that of other boundary conditions.

  experiment and theory","  Phase-contrast microscopy is used to monitor the shapes of micron-scale
fluid-phase phospholipid-bilayer vesicles in aqueous solution. At fixed
temperature, each vesicle undergoes thermal shape fluctuations. We are able
experimentally to characterize the thermal shape ensemble by digitizing the
vesicle outline in real time and storing the time-sequence of images. Analysis
of this ensemble using the area-difference-elasticity (ADE) model of vesicle
shapes allows us to associate (map) each time-sequence to a point in the
zero-temperature (shape) phase diagram. Changing the laboratory temperature
modifies the control parameters (area, volume, etc.) of each vesicle, so it
sweeps out a trajectory across the theoretical phase diagram. It is a
nontrivial test of the ADE model to check that these trajectories remain
confined to regions of the phase diagram where the corresponding shapes are
locally stable. In particular, we study the thermal trajectories of three
prolate vesicles which, upon heating, experienced a mechanical instability
leading to budding. We verify that the position of the observed instability and
the geometry of the budded shape are in reasonable accord with the theoretical
predictions. The inability of previous experiments to detect the ``hidden''
control parameters (relaxed area difference and spontaneous curvature) make
this the first direct quantitative confrontation between vesicle-shape theory
and experiment.

response to include infectious virus and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (cellular
response). The response of the system to virus involves a competition between
the ability of the virus to kill the host cells and the host's ability to
eliminate the virus. We find two basins of attraction in the dynamics of this
system, one is identified with disease and the other with the immune state.
There is also an oscillating state that exists on the border of these two
stable states. Fluctuations in the population of virus or antibody can end the
oscillation and drive the system into one of the stable states. The
introduction of mechanisms of cross-regulation between the two responses can
bias the system towards one of them. We also study a mean field model, based on
coupled maps, to investigate virus-like infections. This simple model
reproduces the attractors for average populations observed in the cellular
automaton. All the dynamical behavior connected to spatial extension is lost,
as is the oscillating feature. Thus the mean field approximation introduced
with coupled maps destroys oscillations.

the study of the formalism, we try to interpret its basic elements (phase

A geometric treatment is given for the considered system dynamics in terms of
the geodesic flows in the Euclidean space where the population variables serve

  variational approach","  Protein folding is analyzed using a replica variational formalism to
investigate some free energy landscape characteristics relevant for dynamics. A
random contact interaction model that satisfies the minimum frustration
principle is used to describe the coil-globule transition (characterized by
T_CG), glass transitions (by T_A and T_K) and folding transition (by T_F).
Trapping on the free energy landscape is characterized by two characteristic
temperatures, one dynamic, T_A the other static, T_K (T_A> T_K), which are
similar to those found in mean field theories of the Potts glass. 1)Above T_A,
the free energy landscape is monotonous and polymer is melted both dynamically
and statically. 2)Between T_A and T_K, the melted phase is still dominant
thermodynamically, but frozen metastable states, exponentially large in number,
appear. 3)A few lowest minima become thermodynamically dominant below T_K,
where the polymer is totally frozen. In the temperature range between T_A and
T_K, barriers between metastable states are shown to grow with decreasing
temperature suggesting super-Arrhenius behavior in a sufficiently large system.
Due to evolutionary constraints on fast folding, the folding temperature T_F is
expected to be higher than T_K, but may or may not be higher than T_A. Diverse
scenarios of the folding kinetics are discussed based on phase diagrams that
take into account the dynamical transition, as well as the static ones.

series of dynamical Monte Carlo simulations on lattice models of proteins.
Based on these highly simplified models, they found that four different
potential energies lead to four different folding time scales tau_f, where
tau_f scales with chain length as N^lambda (see, also, Refs. [2-4]), with
lambda varying from 2.7 to 6.0. However, due to the lack of microscopic models
of protein folding dynamics, the interpretation and origin of the data have
remained somewhat speculative. It is the purpose of this Comment to point out
that the application of a simple ""mesoscopic"" model (cond-mat/9512019, PRL 77,

macroevolution may give rise to self-organized critical phenomena which could
have a significant effect on the dynamics of ecosystems. In particular it has
been suggested that mass extinction may arise through a purely biotic mechanism
as the result of so-called coevolutionary avalanches. In this paper we first
explore the empirical evidence which has been put forward in favor of this
conclusion. The data center principally around the existence of power-law
functional forms in the distribution of the sizes of extinction events and
other quantities. We then propose a new mathematical model of mass extinction
which does not rely on coevolutionary effects and in which extinction is caused
entirely by the action of environmental stresses on species. In combination
with a simple model of species adaptation we show that this process can account
for all the observed data without the need to invoke coevolution and critical
processes. The model also makes some independent predictions, such as the
existence of ``aftershock'' extinctions in the aftermath of large mass
extinction events, which should in theory be testable against the fossil
record.

by numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation. The ring motion is
mediated by finger-shaped loops (hernias) that move in an amoeba-like fashion
around the gel obstructions. This constitutes an extension of previous
reptation tube treatments. It is shown that tension is essential for describing
the dynamics in the presence of hernias. It is included in the model as long
range interactions over stretched DNA regions. The mobility of ring-shaped DNA
is found to saturate much as in the well-studied case of linear DNA.
Experiments in polymer gels, however, show that the mobility drops
exponentially with the DNA ring size. This is commonly attributed to
dangling-ends in the gel that can impale the ring. The predictions of the
present model are expected to apply to artificial 2D obstacle arrays (W.D.
Volkmuth, R.H. Austin, Nature 358,600 (1992)) which have no dangling-ends. In
the zero-field case an exact solution of the model steady-state is obtained,
and quantities such as the average ring size are calculated. An approximate
treatment of the ring dynamics is given, and the diffusion coefficient is
derived. The model is also discussed in the context of spontaneous symmetry
breaking in one dimension.

experiments implicating the importance of calcium ions and ``loosening''
enzymes in morphogenesis. A growing cell at rest in a diffusive calcium
solution is viewed as an elastic shell on short timescales. For a given turgor
pressure, we calculate the stressed shapes of the wall elements whose elastic
properties are determined by Young's modulus and the thickness of the wall. The
local enzyme concentration then determines the rate at which the unstressed
shape of a wall element relaxes toward its stressed shape. The local wall
thickness is calculated from the calcium-mediated addition of material and
thinning due to elongation. We use this model to calculate growth rates for
small perturbations to a circular cell. We find an instability related to
modulations of the wall thickness, leading to growth rates which peak at a
finite wave number.

symbols which constitutes the chromosome, or ``genotype'', and the products
which this sequence encodes --- the ``phenotype''. This interface can be
thought of as a ``computer''. In this case the chromosome is viewed as an
algorithm and the phenotype as the result of the computation. In general only a
small fraction of all possible sequences of symbols makes any sense for a given
computer. The difficulty of finding meaningful algorithms by random mutation is
known as the brittleness problem. In this paper we show that mutation and
crossover favour the emergence of an algorithmic language which facilitates the
production of meaningful sequences following random mutations of the genotype.
We base our conclusions on an analysis of the population dynamics of a variant
of Kitano's neurogenetic model wherein the chromosome encodes the rules for
cellular division and the phenotype is a 16-cell organism interpreted as a
connectivity matrix for a feedforward neural network. We show that an
algorithmic language emerges, describe this language in extenso, and show how
it helps to solve the brittleness problem.

a weakly heterogeneous neuronal network. We consider a model of N neurons with
all-to-all synaptic coupling where the heterogeneity is in the firing frequency
or intrinsic drive of the neurons. We consider both inhibitory and excitatory
coupling. We derive the conditions under which stable phase-locking is
possible. In homogeneous networks, many different periodic phase-locked states
are possible. Their stability depends on the dynamics of the neuron and the
coupling. For weak heterogeneity, the phase-locked states are perturbed from
the homogeneous states and can remain stable if their homogeneous conterparts
are stable. For enough heterogeneity, phase-locked solutions either lose
stability or are destroyed completely. We analyze the possible states the
network can take when phase-locking is broken.

random combination of the constiyuent molecules in each generation,i.e.,
linkage disequilibrium at the population level is neglected. In particular, for
the single-sharp-peak replication landscape we investigate the dependence of
the error threshold on the population size and find that the replication
accuracy at threshold increases linearly with the reciprocal of the population
size for sufficiently large populations. Furthermore, in the deterministic
limit our formulation yields the exact steady-state of the quasispecies model,

structure. Protein crystallography is currently the most successful method for
determining the three-dimensional (3D) conformation of a protein, yet it
remains labor intensive and relies on an expert's ability to derive and
evaluate a protein scene model. In this paper, the problem of protein structure
determination is formulated as an exercise in scene analysis. A computational
methodology is presented in which a 3D image of a protein is segmented into a
graph of critical points. Bayesian and certainty factor approaches are
described and used to analyze critical point graphs and identify meaningful
substructures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Results of applying the
methodologies to protein images at low and medium resolution are reported. The
research is related to approaches to representation, segmentation and
classification in vision, as well as to top-down approaches to protein
structure prediction.

fitness landscapes. As a consequence, the average fitness in the system
increases logarithmically with time, while the rate of extinction steadily
decreases. This dynamics is studied by numerical simulations and, in a simpler
mean field version, analytically. We also study the effect of externally added
`mass' extinctions. The predictions for various quantities of paleontological

molecular motors. It is found that for a backbone flexibility exceeding a
characteristic value (motor stiffness divided through the mean displacement
between attached motors), the ability of motors to produce force reduces as
compared to rigidly coupled motors, while the maximum velocity remains
unchanged. The force-velocity-relation in two different analytic approximations
is calculated and compared with Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, we extend our
model by introducing motors with a strain-dependent detachment rate. A
remarkable crossover from the nearly hyperbolic shape of the Hill curve for
stiff backbones to a linear force-velocity relation for very elastic backbones
is found. With realistic model parameters we show that the backbone flexibility
plays no role under physiological conditions in muscles, but it should be
observable in certain in vitro assays.

one would hope that a universal energy function exists, for which the native
folds of all proteins are the respective ground states. Here we pose a much

for which the energy of the native contact map of a single protein (crambin) is
lower than that of all possible physically realizable decoy maps. We seek such
a set of parameters by perceptron learning, a procedure which is guaranteed to
find such a set if it exists. We found that it is extremely hard (and most
probably, impossible) to fine tune contact parameters that will assign all
alternative conformations higher energy than that of the native map. This
finding clearly indicates that it is impossible to derive a general pairwise
contact potential that can be used to fold any given protein. Inclusion of

modelling of food web structure with the evolutionary modelling of speciation

on an evolutionary timescale. Species are defined as sets of characteristic
features, and these features are used to determine interaction scores between
species. A simple rule is used to transfer resources from the external
environment through the food web to each of the species, and to determine mean
population sizes. A time step in the model represents a speciation event. A new
species is added with features similar to those of one of the existing species
and a new food web structure is then calculated. The new species may (i) add
stably to the web, (ii) become extinct immediately because it is poorly
adapted, or (iii) cause one or more other species to become extinct due to
competition for resources. We measure various properties of the model webs and
compare these with data on real food webs. These properties include the
proportions of basal, intermediate and top species, the number of links per
species and the number of trophic levels. We also study the evolutionary
dynamics of the model ecosystem by following the fluctuations in the total
number of species in the web. Extinction avalanches occur when novel organisms
arise which are significantly better adapted than existing ones. We discuss
these results in relation to the observed extinction events in the fossil

good sampling in conformational space makes it necessary to eliminate the
fastest motions from the system in order to increase the time step. An accurate
knowledge of these motions is a necessary prerequisite for such efforts. It is
known that harmonic vibrations of bond lengths and bond angles produce the
highest frequencies in proteins. There are also fast anharmonic motions, such
as inter-atomic collisions, which are probably most important when bond lengths
and bond angles are fixed. However, the specific time scales corresponding to
all these limitations are not known precisely. In order to clarify the above
issue this paper analyses time step limiting factors in a series of numerical
tests by using an internal coordinate molecular dynamics approach, which allows
chosen internal coordinates to be frozen. It is found that, in proteins, there
is a rather complicated hierarchy of fast motions, with both harmonic and
anharmonic effects mixed together at several close time scales. Non-bonded
interactions, notably strong hydrogen bonding, create locally distributed
normal modes with frequencies similar to those of bond stretching between
non-hydrogen atoms. They also impose ubiquitous anharmonic limitations starting
from rather small step sizes. With fixed standard amino acid geometry,
rotations of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups limit time steps at the 5 fsec

for example by replication (and death) of units according to their internal

regulation of the probability for the differentiation provides the diversity

a large number of frustrated states, which result in conformational phases of
the random coil and the frozen globule. We have also found that for a certain
class of sequences the frustrated phases are suppressed. The kinetics of
folding from the extended coil to the globule proceeds through non-equilibrium

accounting for the interactions between proteins and amphiphilic molecules, we
obtain the spatial protein distribution with the following characteristics.
When the proteins preferentially interact with either the liquid condensed or
liquid expanded domains, they will be dissolved in the respective phase. When
the proteins are energetically rather indifferent to the density of the
amphiphiles, they will be localized at the line boundary between the
(two-dimensional) liquid expanded and condensed phases. In between these two
limiting cases, a delocalization transition of the proteins takes place. This
transition is accessible by changing the temperature or the amount of

the presence of relatively loud noise. Following the discovery of nondynamical
and of aperiodic stochastic resonance, it was recently shown that the
phenomenon can manifest itself even in the presence of nonstationary signals.
This was found in a composite system of differentiated trigger mechanisms
mounted in parallel, which suggests that it could be realized in some
elementary neural networks or nonlinear electronic circuits. Here, we find that
even an individual trigger system may be able to detect weak nonstationary
signals using stochastic resonance. The very simple modification to the trigger
mechanism that makes this possible is reminiscent of some aspects of actual
neuron physics. Stochastic resonance may thus become relevant to more types of
biological or electronic systems injected with an ever broader class of
realistic signals.

nonlinear system may sometimes facilitate, rather than hamper the detection of
weak signals. This phenomenon, usually referred to as stochastic resonance, was
originally associated with strictly periodic signals, but it was eventually
shown to occur for stationary aperiodic signals as well. However, in several
situations of practical interest, the signal can be markedly nonstationary. We
demonstrate that the phenomenon of stochastic resonance extends to
nonstationary signals as well, and thus could be relevant to a wider class of
biological and electronic applications. Building on both nondynamic and
aperiodic stochastic resonance, our scheme is based on a multilevel trigger
mechanism, which could be realized as a parallel network of differentiated
threshold sensors. We find that optimal detection is reached for a number of
thresholds of order ten, and that little is gained by going much beyond that
number. We raise the question of whether this is related to the fact that
evolution has favored some fixed numbers of precisely this order of magnitude
in certain aspects of sensory perception.

the test tube is similar to how proteins form the so-called ``amyloid''
deposits that are the pathological signal of a variety of diseases, among them
the memory disorder Alzheimer's. Protein aggregation have traditionally been
connected to either unfolded or native states. Inclusion body formation
(disordered aggregation) has been assumed to arise from hydrophobic aggregation
of the unfolded or denaturated states, while the amyloid fibrils (ordered
aggregation) have been assumed to arise from native-like conformations in a
process analogous to the polymerization of hemoglobin S. Making use of
lattice-model simulations we find that both ordered and disordered aggregation
arise from elementary structures which eventually build the folding nucleus of
the heteropolymers, and takes place when some of the most strongly interacting
amino acids establish their contacts leading to the formation of a specific
subset of the native structure. These elementary structures can be viewed as
the partially folded intermediates suggested to be involved in the aggregation
of a number of proteins. These results have evolutionary implications, as the
elementary structures forming the folding core of designed proteins contain the
residues which are conserved among the members of homologous sequences.

folding ability than a parameter $\sigma$ that requires simulation for its
evaluation: $\sigma = 1 - T_f/T_\theta$, where $T_f$ is the temperature at
which the fluctuation of the order parameter is at its maximum and $T_\theta$

  flow in the amoeboid organism of Physarum plasmodium","  The amoeboid organism, the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, behaves on
the basis of spatio-temporal pattern formation by local
contraction-oscillators. This biological system can be regarded as a
reaction-diffusion system which has spatial interaction by active flow of
protoplasmic sol in the cell. Paying attention to the physiological evidence
that the flow is determined by contraction pattern in the plasmodium, a
reaction-diffusion system having self-determined flow arises. Such a coupling
of reaction-diffusion-advection is a characteristic of the biological system,
and is expected to relate with control mechanism of amoeboid behaviours. Hence,
we have studied effects of the self-determined flow on pattern formation of
simple reaction-diffusion systems. By weakly nonlinear analysis near a trivial
solution, the envelope dynamics follows the complex Ginzburg-Landau type
equation just after bifurcation occurs at finite wave number. The flow term
affects the nonlinear term of the equation through the critical wave number
squared. Contrary to this, wave number isn't explicitly effective with lack of
flow or constant flow. Thus, spatial size of pattern is especially important
for regulating pattern formation in the plasmodium. On the other hand, the flow
term is negligible in the vicinity of bifurcation at infinitely small wave
number, and therefore the pattern formation by simple reaction-diffusion will
also hold. A physiological role of pattern formation as above is discussed.

environmental ATP in order to propel unidirectionally along cytoskeletal
filaments such as microtubules. In the case of kinesin, protein heads bind
primarily on the alpha tubulin site of asymmetric alpha-beta 8nm-long tubulin
dimers that constitute the microtubular protofilaments. Kinesin dimers overcome
local binding forces up to 5pN and are known to move on protofilaments with ATP
concentration-dependent speeds while hydrolizing on average one ATP molecule
per 8nm step. The salient features of protein trajectories are the distinct
abrupt usually 8nm-long steps from one tubulin dimer to the next interlaced
with long quiescent binding periods at a tubulin site. Discrete walks of this
type are characterized by substantially reduced variances compared to pure
biased random walks, and as a result rule out flashing-type ratchet models as
possible mechanisms for motor movement. On the other hand, simple additive
correlated brownian ratchets that present exactly these discrete trajectory
patterns with reduced variances are compatible with the general features of
protein motion. In the simplest such model the protein is simplified to a
single particle moving in a periodic non-symmetric tubulin-derived potential
and the environmental and ATP interaction is included in a correlated additive
noise term. For this model we show that the resulting protein walk has features
resembling experimental data. Furthermore, in more realistic mechanical models
of two masses connected by a spring we find qualitative agreement with recent
experimental facts related to motion of protein chimaeras formed through
kinesin motor domains with non-claret disjunctional (ncd) neck regions.

used two analogues of the peptide with charged and neutral side chains of Glu-2

between the ground state and the excited compact conformations, and $\Gamma$
the dispersion in energy of excited compact conformations. These two criteria
are not incompatible since, on average, sequences whose ground states are
highly designable structures have large $\Delta/\Gamma$ values. These two
criteria require knowledge only of the compact-state spectrum. These claims are
substantiated by the study of 45 sequences, with various values of
$\Delta/\Gamma$ and various degrees of designability, by means of a
Borst-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, and the Ferrenberg-Swendsen histogram
optimization method. Finally, we report on the reasons for slow folding. A
comparison between a very slow folding sequence, an average folding one and a
fast folding one suggests that slow folding originates from a proliferation of
nearly compact low-energy conformations, not present for fast folders.

based on hydrophobicity forces and sequence independent local interactions. The
latter are chosen so as to favor the formation of alpha-helical structure. They
model chirality and alpha-helical hydrogen bonding. The global structures
resulting from the competition between these forces are studied by means of an
efficient Monte Carlo method. The model is tested on two sequences of length
N=21 and 33 which are intended to form 2- and 3-helix bundles, respectively.
The local structure of our model proteins is compared to that of real
alpha-helical proteins, and is found to be very similar. The two sequences
display the desired numbers of helices in the folded phase. Only a few
different relative orientations of the helices are thermodynamically allowed.
Our ability to investigate the thermodynamics relies heavily upon the
efficiency of the used algorithm, simulated tempering; in this Monte Carlo
approach, the temperature becomes a fluctuating variable, enabling the crossing

interactions on a molecular scale, with the goal of gaining insight into the
molecular origins of hydrophobic effects. The model is based on the fundamental
relation between the probability for cavity formation in bulk water resulting
from molecular-scale density fluctuations, and the hydration free energy of the
simplest hydrophobic solute, a hard particle. This probability is estimated
using an information theory (IT) approach, incorporating experimentally
available properties of bulk water -- the density and radial distribution
function. The IT approach reproduces the simplest hydrophobic effects:
hydration of spherical nonpolar solutes, the potential of mean force between
methane molecules, and solvent contributions to the torsional equilibrium of
butane. Applications of this approach to study temperature and pressure effects
provide new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding.
The IT model relates the hydrophobic-entropy convergence observed in protein
unfolding experiments to the macroscopic isothermal compressibility of water. A
novel explanation for pressure denaturation of proteins follows from an
analysis of the pressure stability of hydrophobic aggregates, suggesting that
water penetrates the hydrophobic core of proteins at high pressures. This
resolves a long-standing puzzle, whether pressure denaturation contradicts the
hydrophobic-core model of protein stability. Finally, issues of ``dewetting''
of molecularly large nonpolar solutes are discussed in the context of a
recently developed perturbation theory approach.

intricate network of synaptic connections that are generated during the system
development. During the network formation, the growth cones migrate through the
embryonic environment to their targets using chemical communication. A major
obstacle in the elucidation of fundamental principles underlying this
self-wiring is the complexity of the system being analyzed. Hence much effort
is devoted to in-vitro experiments of simpler 2D model systems. In these
experiments neurons are placed on Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) surfaces so it is easier
to monitor their self-wiring. We developed a model to reproduce the salient
features of the 2D systems, inspired by the study of bacterial colony's growth
and the aggregation of amoebae. We represent the neurons (each composed of
cell's soma, neurites and growth cones) by active elements that capture the
generic features of the real neurons. The model also incorporates stationary
units representing the cells' soma and communicating walkers representing the
growth cones. The stationary units send neurites one at a time, and respond to
chemical signaling. The walkers migrate in response to chemotaxis substances
emitted by the soma and communicate with each other and with the soma by means
of chemotactic ``feedback''. The interplay between the chemo-repulsive and
chemo-attractive responses is determined by the dynamics of the walker's
internal energy which is controlled by the soma. These features enable the
neurons to perform the complex task of self-wiring.

of the process of speciation as a consequence of genetic divergence. In this
metaphor, biological populations diverge along connected clusters of well-fit
genotypes in a multidimensional adaptive landscape and become reproductively
isolated species when they come to be on opposite sides of a ``hole'' in the
adaptive landscape. No crossing of any adaptive valleys is required. I
formulate and study a series of simple models describing the dynamics of
speciation on holey adaptive landscapes driven by mutation and random genetic
drift. Unlike most previous models that concentrate only on some stages of
speciation, the models studied here describe the complete process of speciation
from initiation until completion. The evolutionary factors included are
selection (reproductive isolation), random genetic drift, mutation,
recombination, and migration. In these models, pre- and post-mating
reproductive isolation is a consequence of cumulative genetic change. I study
possibilities for speciation according to allopatric, parapatric, peripatric
and vicariance scenarios. The analytic theory satisfactorily matches results of
individual-based simulations reported by Gavrilets et al. (1998). It is
demonstrated that rapid speciation including simultaneous emergence of several
new species is a plausible outcome of the evolutionary dynamics of subdivided
populations. I consider effects of population size, population subdivision, and
local adaptation on the dynamics of speciation. I briefly discuss some
implications of the dynamics on holey adaptive landscapes for molecular
evolution.

genetic drift. Distinctive features of the simulations are the consideration of

hundreds of generations is plausible without the need for extreme founder
events, complete geographic isolation, the existence of distinct adaptive peaks
or selection for local adaptation. The plausibility of speciation is enhanced

  Control of Cell Function","  Living cells are soft bodies of a characteristic form, but endowed with a
capacity for a steady turnover of their structures. Both of these material
properties, i.e. recovery of the shape after an external stress has been
imposed and dynamic structural reorganization, are essential for many cellular
phenomena. Examples are mechanical properties of tissue, cell motility, cell
growth and division, and active intracellular transport. Numerous experiments
in vivo and in vitro have shown that the structural element responsible for the
extraordinary mechanical and dynamical properties of eukaryotic cells is the
cytoskeleton, a three-dimensional assembly of protein fibers such as actin
filaments and microtubules. In addition to those biopolymers various proteins
with structural and regulatory functions have a major influence on the
mechanical properties. At the relevant length-scales (a few microns at most)
the building blocks of these biomaterials are very different from conventional
polymeric material. In contrast to flexible polymers the persistence length is
of the same order of magnitude as their total contour length or even larger.
This implies that the physics of such a system is determined by a subtle
interplay between energetic and entropic contributions. We review our present
understanding of the physics of biopolymers using concepts from macromolecular
and statistical physics complemented by computer simulation. These systems open
up a new field of soft condensed matter research, which to date is only poorly
understood but has a great potential for interesting new physical phenomena.

explaining the degeneracy of the genetic code using basic classical Lie

  Pleiotropy","  We investigate the behavior of a population genetics model introduced by
Waxman and Peck incorporating mutation, selection, and pleiotropy. The
population is infinite and continuous variation of genotype is allowed.
Nonetheless, Waxman and Peck showed that if the degree of pleiotropy is large
enough,in this model a nonzero fraction of the population can have identical
alleles. This `condensed mode' behavior appears in the limit of infinite times.
  This paper explores the time-dependence of the distribution of alleles in
this model. First, the model is analyzed using a recursion technique which
enables the distribution of alleles to be calculated at finite times as well as
in Waxman and Peck's infinite-time limit. Second, both Waxman and Peck's
original model and a related model in which mutations occur continuously are
mapped onto problems in quantum mechanics. In both cases, the long-time
analysis for the biological model is equivalent to finding the nature of the
eigenstates of the quantum problem. The condensed mode appears if and only if
there is no bound state in the quantum problem.
  We compare the behavior of the discrete- and continuous-time versions of the
model. The results for the two cases are qualitatively similar, though there
are some quantitative differences. We also discuss our attempts to correlate
the statistics of DNA sequence variations with the degree of pleiotropy of
various genes.

model describing the joint dynamics of taxonomic diversity and morphological
disparity is presented and applied to the data on the diversification of
blastozoans. I show that the observed patterns of deceleration in clade
diversification can be explicable in terms of the geometric structure of the
morphospace and the effects of extinction and speciation on morphological
disparity without invoking major declines in the size of morphological
transitions or taxonomic turnover rates. The model allows testing of hypotheses
about patterns of diversification and estimation of rates of morphological
evolution. In the case of blastozoans, I find no evidence that major changes in
evolutionary rates and mechanisms are responsible for the deceleration of
morphological diversification seen during the period of this clade's expansion.
At the same time, there is evidence for a moderate decline in overall rates of
morphological diversification concordant with a major change (from positive to
negative values) in the clade's growth rate.

  Protein Models","  Background: Designing amino acid sequences that are stable in a given target
structure amounts to maximizing a conditional probability. A straightforward
approach to accomplish this is a nested Monte Carlo where the conformation
space is explored over and over again for different fixed sequences, which
requires excessive computational demand. Several approximate attempts to remedy
this situation, based on energy minimization for fixed structure or high-$T$
expansions, have been proposed. These methods are fast but often not accurate
since folding occurs at low $T$.
  Results: We develop a multisequence Monte Carlo procedure, where both
sequence and conformation space are simultaneously probed with efficient
prescriptions for pruning sequence space. The method is explored on
hydrophobic/polar models. We first discuss short lattice chains, in order to
compare with exact data and with other methods. The method is then successfully
applied to lattice chains with up to 50 monomers, and to off-lattice 20-mers.
  Conclusions: The multisequence Monte Carlo method offers a new approach to
sequence design in coarse-grained models. It is much more efficient than
previous Monte Carlo methods, and is, as it stands, applicable to a fairly wide
range of two-letter models.

investigated using a simple worm like chain model. In the limit of small force
there are large conformational fluctuations which are treated using a
self-consistent variational approach. For small values of the external force f,
we find theoreticlly and by a simple blob picture that the extension scales as
fr_D where r_D is the Debye screening length. In the limit of large force the
electrostatic effects can be accounted for within the semiflexible chain model
of DNA by assuming that only small excursions from rod-like conformations are
possible. In this regime the extension approaches the contour length as
f^{-1/2} where f is the magnitude of the external force. The theory is used to
analyze experiments that have measured the extension of double-stranded DNA
subject to tension at various salt concentrations. The theory reproduces nearly
quantitatively the elastic response of DNA at small and large values of f and
for all concentration of the monovalent counterions. The limitations of the
theory are also pointed out.

predicts the experimentally observed intracellular ionic concentration of
potassium, calcium, and sodium. Likewise the shapes of the simulated action
potential and five membrane currents are in good agreement with experiments. We
do not see any drift in the values of the concentrations in a long time

full equilibrium situation with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic
concentrations.

of the theory of evolution. The idea of adaptive walks in fitness landscapes
has triggered a vast amount of research and has led to many important insights
about the progress of evolution. Nevertheless, the small step to time-dependent
fitness landscapes has most of the time not been taken. In this work, some
elements of a theory of adaptive walks on changing fitness landscapes are
proposed, and are subsequently applied to and tested on a simple family of
time-dependent fitness landscapes, the oscillating NK landscapes, also
introduced here. For these landscapes, the parameter governing the evolutionary
dynamics is the fraction of static fitness contributions f_S. For small f_S,
local optima are virtually non-existent, and the adaptive walk constantly
encounters new genotypes, whereas for large f_S, the evolutionary dynamics
reduces to the one on static fitness landscapes. Evidence is presented that the
transition between the two regimes is a 2nd order phase transition akin a
percolation transition. For f_S close to the critical point, a rich dynamics
can be observed. The adaptive walk gets trapped in noisy limit cycles, and
transitions from one noisy limit cycle to another occur sporadically.

the existence of extended neutral networks in sequence space -- sequences can
evolve until their similarity with the starting point is almost the same as for
random sequences. Furthermore, we find that the rate of neutral mutations has a
broad distribution in sequence space. Due to this fact, the substitution

exhibits robust statistical properties summarized by three notions: (1) the
notion of a typical shape (that among all sequences of fixed length certain
shapes are realized much more frequently than others), (2) the notion of shape
space covering (that all typical shapes are realized in a small neighborhood of
any random sequence), and (3) the notion of a neutral network (that sequences
folding into the same typical shape form networks that percolate through
sequence space). Neutral networks loosen the requirements on the mutation rate
for selection to remain effective. The original (genotypic) error threshold has
to be reformulated in terms of a phenotypic error threshold. With regard to
adaptation, neutrality has two seemingly contradictory effects: It acts as a
buffer against mutations ensuring that a phenotype is preserved. Yet it is
deeply enabling, because it permits evolutionary change to occur by allowing
the sequence context to vary silently until a single point mutation can become
phenotypically consequential. Neutrality also influences predictability of
adaptive trajectories in seemingly contradictory ways. On the one hand it
increases the uncertainty of their genotypic trace. At the same time neutrality
structures the access from one shape to another, thereby inducing a topology
among RNA shapes which permits a distinction between continuous and
discontinuous shape transformations. To the extent that adaptive trajectories
must undergo such transformations, their phenotypic trace becomes more
predictable.

a polar symmetry. One type of white blood cells (granulocytes) form clusters
where the cells are oriented towards the center. The core of such an
orientational defect (disclination) is either a granulocyte forced to be in an
isotropic state or another cell type like a monocyte. An apolar nematic liquid
crystal is formed if the interaction has an apolar symmetry. Different cell
types like human melanocytes (=pigment cells of the skin), human fibroblasts

(= fat cells) etc., form an apolar nematic liquid crystal. The orientational
elastic energy is derived and the orientational defects (disclination) of
nematic liquid crystals are investigated. The existence of half-numbered
disclinations show that the nematic phase has an apolar symmetry. The density-

absolute values are estimated. From the defect structure, one finds that the
splay elastic constant is smaller than the bend elastic constant (melanocytes).
The core of a disclination is either a cell free space or occupied by non

symmetry or occupied by another cell type.

is searched within all possible structures or within maximally compact

not. Third, the effect of the length of the chain, namely, the number of

phenomena that are difficult to explain using rational expectations models.
This paper studies these using a nonequilibrium price formation rule, developed
in the context of trading with market orders. Because this is so much simpler
than a standard inter-temporal equilibrium model, it is possible to study
multi-period markets analytically. There price dynamics have second order
oscillatory terms.
  Value investing does not necessarily cause prices to track values. Trend
following causes short term trends in prices, but also causes longer-term
oscillations. When value investing and trend following are combined, even
though there is little linear structure, there can be boom-bust cycles,excess
and temporally correlated volatility, and fat tails in price fluctuations. The
long term evolution of markets can be studied in terms of flows of money.
  Profits can be decomposed in terms of aggregate pairwise correlations.
  Under reinvestment of profits this leads to a capital allocation model that
is equivalent to a standard model in population biology. An investigation of
market efficiency shows that patterns created by trend followers are more
resistant to efficiency than those created by value investors, and that profit
maximizing behavior slows the progression to efficiency. Order of magnitude
estimates suggest that the timescale for efficiency is years to decades.

which functional organization, interaction, and thus selection, operate. In
spite of the obvious links between this suggestion and research into complex
social organization amongst insects and other social animals, the levels of
selection model has seen little use among anthropologists. We suggest that the
primary reason for lack of research into the evolutionary causes of social
complexity has been the lack of descriptive units with which we can examine
phenotypic variation and heritability of social organization above the level of
the organism. The goal of our paper, therefore, is to begin constructing
descriptive units which map to meaningful models of multi-level selection. In
order to demonstrate how these units are useful in a real dataset, we examine
the functional changes involved in the United States economy over the last 100
years, a period of time characterized, we believe, by significant changes in
the number and kinds of social aggregates functioning as ""individuals"" with
respect to selection. Our preliminary analysis suggests that it is possible to
measure changes in the scale at which functional integration occurs through
published data, and that the multilevel selection model for complex society may
possess considerable power for describing how selection of culturally
transmitted variation occurs in complex societies.

excitative (72.9%); there are also a small amount of PC showing inhibitive
(10.2%) or no (16.9%) response to HA. (2) Different from the conventional
opinion, HA's excitative effect on PC is mutually conducted by H1 and H2
receptors; the antagonist for H1 receptor could weaken HA's excitative effect
on PC, while the antagonist for H2 receptor could weaken or even block the
excitative effect of HA on PC. (3) PC's reaction to HA is related to its
intrinsic discharge frequency; there exists a frequency at which PC is highly
sensitive to HA, and well above this frequency PC becomes stable against HA.
These results indicate that the histaminergic afferent fibre can adjust PC's
electric activities by releasing HA, and thereby influence the global function
of the cerebellar cortex; and that just like the $\gamma $ region of cerebrum,
cerebellum may also have some sort of characteristic frequency.

`directed percolation'), but instead of using an infection or recovery rate as
control parameter, the population size is controlled directly and globally by
removing excess plants. We show that the model is very closely related to
directed percolation (DP). Anomalous scaling laws appear in the limit of large
populations, small densities, and long times. These laws, associated critical
exponents, and even some non-universal parameters, can be related to those of
DP. As in invasion percolation and in other models where the r\^oles of control

spike trains exhibit universal behavior over short time, modulated by a
stimulus-dependent envelope over long time. A model of the neuron as a
nonlinear oscillator driven by noise and an external stimulus, is suggested to
account for these results. The model enables a theoretic distinction of the
effects of internal neuronal properties from effects of external stimulus
properties, and their identification in the measured spike trains. The
universal regime is characterized by one dimensionless parameter, representing
the internal degree of irregularity, which is determined both by the
sensitivity of the neuron and by the properties of the noise. The envelope is
related in a simple way to properties of the input stimulus as seen through
nonlinearity of the neural response. Explicit formulas are derived for
different statistical properties in both the universal and the

By comparing the information carried by a compound pattern with the information

mixture of lipid molecules is investigated. In the proposed model, the
inclusion-induced deformation of the film, and the resulting energy cost are
strongly dependent upon the spontaneous curvature of the mixed film. The
spontaneous curvature is in turn strongly influenced by the composition of
film. This coupling between the film composition and the energy per inclusion
leads to a lateral modulation of the composition, which follows the local
curvature of the membrane. In particular, it is shown that the inclusion may
induce a global phase separation in a film which would otherwise be
homogeneously mixed. The mixed film is then composed of patches of different
average composition, separated by the inclusions. This process may be of
relevance to explain some aspects of lipid-protein association in biological
membranes.

conformational changes in the protein which induce transactivation or

Unbinding was induced on a time scale of 1 ns by applying external forces to

states in a neuronal network model that represents part of thalamic circuitry.
Our model neurons have a Hodgkin-Huxley-type low threshold Calcium channel,
display post inhibitory rebound, and are connected via GABAergic inhibitory
synapses. We find that there is a threshold in synaptic strength, $\tau_c$,
below which there are no stable spiking network states. Above threshold the
stable spiking state is a cluster state, where different groups of neurons fire
consecutively, and each neuron fires with the same cluster each time. Weak
noise destabilizes this state, but stronger noise drives the system into a
different, self-organized, stochastically synchronized state. Neuronal firing
is still organized in clusters, but individual neurons can hop from cluster to
cluster. Noise can actually induce and sustain such a state below the threshold
of synaptic strength. We do find a qualitative difference in the firing
patterns between small ($\sim 10$ neurons) and large ($\sim 1000$ neurons)
networks. We determine the information content of the spike trains in terms of
two separate contributions: the spike time jitter around cluster firing times,
and the hopping from cluster to cluster. We quantify the information loss due
to temporally correlated interspike intervals. Recent experiments on the locust
olfactory system and striatal neurons suggest that the nervous system may
actually use these two channels to encode separate and unique information.

a genuine biological advantage. This is due to the phenomenon of chiral
interaction (CI) which is described here for mechanical-chiral devices. The
main mechanical feature of chiral interaction is its mode of selecting one
direction of rotation out of two possible and opposite ones. For example, a
given chiral device such as a rotating water sprinkler, rotates in one
direction. What does rotate in the opposite direction is the mirror of this
given sprinkler. This mode of operation indicates space-time (PT) invariance
which causes it to be also time-irreversible. This also causes a chiral device
to become non-ergodic on microscopic level. This prevents certain chiral
systems from readily reaching thermal equilibrium, and causes the system to act
non-ergodically, which is crucial for living systems as well as for molecular
evolution.

been investigated. Milk and methylene blue doped milk were used as tissue
phantoms for the measurements carried out with a He-Ne laser (632.8nm). Results
indicate that while the technique accurately estimates the transport length, it
can determine the absorption coefficient only when the absorption is moderately

electroencephalographic (EEG) data is that the data be statistically
stationary. We have investigated the stationarity of 21-electrode multivariate
EEG data recorded from ten patients during generalized tonic-clonic (GTC)
seizures elicited by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Stationarity was examined
by calculating probability density functions (pdfs) and power spectra over
small equal-length non-overlapping time windows and then by studying visually
and quantitatively the evolution of these quantities over the duration of the
seizures. Our analysis shows that most of the seizures had time intervals of at
least a few seconds that were statistically stationary by several criteria and
simultaneously for different electrodes, and that some leads were delayed in
manifesting the statistical changes associated with seizure onset evident in
other leads. The stationarity across electrodes was further examined by
studying redundancy of the EEG leads and how that redundancy evolved over the
course of the GTC seizures. Using several different measures, we found a
substantial redundancy which suggests that fewer than 21 electrodes will likely
suffice for extracting dynamical and clinical insights. The redundancy analysis
also demonstrates for the first time posterior-to-anterior time delays in the
mid-ictal region of GTC seizures, which suggests the existence of propagating
waves. The implications of these results are discussed for understanding GTC
seizures and ECT treatment.

a polymer system, some nuclei hinder folding via topological constraints and
must be partially destroyed in order for folding to proceed. To illustrate this
finding, we examine the kinetics of protein unfolding in the long chain limit

the critical nucleus size is of the order of the entire chain size so that
unfolding time scales as $\exp [c N^{2/3} ]$, where $N$ and $c$ are the chain

about the alpha to beta-carbon and beta to gamma-carbon bonds of the leucine
side chain and of 10 NOESY cross relaxation rates across these bonds. Molecular
mechanics and peptide and protein crystallographic databases are an essential
part of this analysis because they independently suggest that the trans
gauche-plus and gauche-minus trans rotational isomers of the leucine side chain
predominate. They also both suggest that puckering of the cobalt dipeptide ring
system reduces the gauche-plus gauche-plus rotational isomer population to less
than about 10%. At the present +/- 1 Hz calibration accuracy of Karplus
equations for vicinal coupling constants, the predominant trans gauche-plus and
gauche-minus trans rotational isomer populations can be measured with about 5%
accuracy, but the population of the gauche-plus gauche-plus rotational isomer
is probably very near or just below the limit of measurability. These estimates
also depend upon qualitative assessments of the accuracy of the molecular
mechanics energy wells. We introduce gel graphics that are ideally suited to

the kinetics of the early stages of homopolymer collapse following a quench
from temperatures above to below the theta temperature. In the first stage,
nascent droplets of the dense phase are formed, with little effect on the
configurations of the bridges that join them. The droplets then grow by
accreting monomers from the bridges, thus causing the bridges to stretch.
During these two stages the overall dimensions of the chain decrease only
weakly. Further growth of the droplets is accomplished by the shortening of the
bridges, which causes the shrinking of the overall dimensions of the chain. The
characteristic times of the three stages respectively scale as the zeroth, 1/5
and 6/5 power of the the degree of polymerization of the chain.

stretching. We provide a theoretical framework for these experiments by
computing the phase diagrams for force-induced unfolding of single domain
proteins using lattice models. The results show that two-state folders (at zero
force) unravel cooperatively whereas stretching of non-two-state folders occurs
through intermediates. The stretching rates of individual molecules show great
variations reflecting the heterogeneity of force-induced unfolding pathways.
The approach to the stretched state occurs in a step-wise ""quantized"" manner.
Unfolding dynamics depends sensitively on topology. The unfolding rates
increase exponentially with force f till an optimum value which is determined
by the barrier to unfolding when f=0. A mapping of these results to proteins
shows qualitative agreement with force-induced unfolding of Ig-like domains in
titin. We show that single molecule force spectroscopy can be used to map the
folding free energy landscape of proteins in the absence of denaturants.

interactions describing the dynamical structure of DNA is proposed. Dispersive
interactions of two types: the power dependence $r^{-s}$ and the exponential
dependence $e^{-\beta r}$ on the distance, $r$, are studied. For $s$ less than
some critical value, $s_{cr}$, and similarly for $\beta \leq \beta_{cr}$ there
is an interval of bistability where two stable stationary states: narrow,
pinned states and broad, mobile states exist at each value of the total energy.
For cubic nonlinearity the bistability of the solitons occurs for dipole-dipole
dispersive interaction $(s=3)$, and for the inverse radius of the dispersive
interaction $\beta \leq \beta_{cr}=1.67$. For increasing degree of
nonlinearity, $\sigma$, the critical values $s_{cr}$ and $\beta_{cr}$ increase.
The long-distance behavior of the intrinsically localized states depends on
$s$. For $s>3$ their tails are exponential while for $2<s<3$ they are
algebraic. A controlled switching between pinned and mobile states is
demonstrated applying a spatially symmetric perturbation in the form of a
parametric kick. The mechanism could be important for controlling energy

includes equations with the same morphology parameters as in percolation

the bridging effect resulting from the deviations of the local conductivity

visual cortex. This theory is based on the premise that OD pattern is an
adaptation to minimize the length of intra-cortical wiring. Thus we can
understand the existing OD patterns by solving a wire length minimization
problem. We divide all the neurons into two classes: left-eye dominated and
right-eye dominated. We find that segregation of neurons into monocular regions
reduces wire length if the number of connections with the neurons of the same
class differs from that with the other class. The shape of the regions depends
on the relative fraction of neurons in the two classes. If the numbers are
close we find that the optimal OD pattern consists of interdigitating stripes.
If one class is less numerous than the other, the optimal OD pattern consists
of patches of the first class neurons in the sea of the other class neurons. We
predict the transition from stripes to patches when the fraction of neurons
dominated by the ipsilateral eye is about 40%. This prediction agrees with the
data in macaque and Cebus monkeys. This theory can be applied to other binary
cortical systems.

theoretically. Attractive correlations, induced in the polymer because of the
interaction, compete with intra-chain repulsion and eventually drive a joint
self-assembly of the two species, accompanied by partial collapse of the chain.
Results of the analysis are found to be in good agreement with experiments on
the onset of self-assembly in diverse polymer-surfactant systems. The threshold
concentration for self-assembly in the mixed system (critical aggregation
concentration, cac) is always lower than the one in the polymer-free solution
(critical micelle concentration, cmc). Several self-assembly regimes are
distinguished, depending on the effective interaction between the two species.
For strong interaction, corresponding experimentally to oppositely charged
species, the cac is much lower than the cmc. It increases with ionic strength
and depends only weakly on polymer charge. For weak interaction, the cac is
lower but comparable to the cmc, and the two are roughly proportional over a
wide range of cmc values. Association of small molecules with amphiphilic

seconds are typically much shorter than the relevant dynamical timescales
(~0.001-0.1 seconds), both for regular neuron firing and for kink-like
polarization excitations in microtubules. This conclusion disagrees with
suggestions by Penrose and others that the brain acts as a quantum computer,
and that quantum coherence is related to consciousness in a fundamental way.

under multiplicative selection, mutation and drift. The number of beneficial
alleles in a multi-locus system can be considered a trait under exponential
selection. Equations of motion are derived for the cumulants of the trait
distribution in the diffusion limit and under the assumption of linkage
equilibrium. Because of the additive nature of cumulants, this reduces to the
problem of determining equations of motion for the expected allele distribution
cumulants at each locus. The cumulant equations form an infinite dimensional
linear system and in an authored appendix Adam Prugel-Bennett provides a closed
form expression for these equations. We derive approximate solutions which are
shown to describe the dynamics well for a broad range of parameters. In
particular, we introduce two approximate analytical solutions: (1) Perturbation
theory is used to solve the dynamics for weak selection and arbitrary mutation
rate. The resulting expansion for the system's eigenvalues reduces to the known
diffusion theory results for the limiting cases with either mutation or
selection absent. (2) For low mutation rates we observe a separation of
time-scales between the slowest mode and the rest which allows us to develop an
approximate analytical solution for the dominant slow mode. The solution is
consistent with the perturbation theory result and provides a good
approximation for much stronger selection intensities.

strongest indications is the sequence homology among families of proteins that
perform similar biological functions in different species. The number of
proteins in a family can grow over time as genetic information is duplicated
through evolution. We explore how evolution directs the size distribution of
these families. Theoretical predictions for family sizes are obtained from two
models, one in which individual genes duplicate and a second in which the
entire genome duplicates. Predictions from these models are compared with the
family size distributions for several organisms whose complete genome sequence
is known. We find that protein family size distributions in nature follow a
power-law distribution. Comparing these results to the model systems, we
conclude that genome duplication is the dominant mechanism leading to increased
genetic material in the species considered.

INtelligence'' (COIN). A COIN is a large multi-agent system where:
  (i) There is little to no centralized communication or control; and
  (ii) There is a provided world utility function that rates the possible
histories of the full system.
  In particular, we are interested in COINs in which each agent runs a
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Rather than use a conventional modeling
approach (e.g., model the system dynamics, and hand-tune agents to cooperate),
we aim to solve the COIN design problem implicitly, via the ``adaptive''
character of the RL algorithms of each of the agents. This approach introduces
an entirely new, profound design problem: Assuming the RL algorithms are able
to achieve high rewards, what reward functions for the individual agents will,
when pursued by those agents, result in high world utility? In other words,
what reward functions will best ensure that we do not have phenomena like the
tragedy of the commons, Braess's paradox, or the liquidity trap?
  Although still very young, research specifically concentrating on the COIN
design problem has already resulted in successes in artificial domains, in
particular in packet-routing, the leader-follower problem, and in variants of
Arthur's El Farol bar problem. It is expected that as it matures and draws upon
other disciplines related to COINs, this research will greatly expand the range
of tasks addressable by human engineers. Moreover, in addition to drawing on
them, such a fully developed scie nce of COIN design may provide much insight
into other already established scientific fields, such as economics, game
theory, and population biology.

due to strong cation correlations at the surface of DNA the net charge of DNA
changes sign at some small concentration of cations N_0. DNA condensation takes
place in the vicinity of N_0, where absolute value of the DNA net charge is
small and the correlation induced short range attraction dominates the Coulomb
repulsion. At N > N_0 positive DNA should move in the oppisite direction in an
electrophoresis experiment. From comparison of our theory with experimental
values of condensation and resolubilization thresholds for DNA solution
containing Spe$^{4+}$, we obtain that N_0 = 3.2 mM and that the energy of DNA
condensation per nucleotide is $0.07 k_B T$.

proteins, is often interpreted in terms of a simple model of hard spheres with
short-ranged attraction. While such a model yields a qualitative understanding
of the generic phase diagrams of both colloids and proteins, it fails to
capture one important difference: the model predicts fluid-fluid phase
separation in the metastable regime below the freezing curve. Such demixing has
been observed for globular proteins, but for colloids it appears to be
pre-empted by the appearance of a gel. In this paper, we study the effect of
additional long-range attractions on the phase behavior of spheres with
short-ranged attraction. We find that such attractions can shift the
(metastable) fluid-fluid critical point out of the gel region. As this
metastable critical point may be important for crystal nucleation, our results
suggest that long-ranged attractive forces may play an important role in the
crystallization of globular proteins. However, in colloids, where refractive
index matching is often used to switch off long-ranged dispersion forces,
gelation is likely to inhibit phase separation.

the CPG. This is a ``closed'' network topology. An ``open'' topology, where one
or more neurons receives input but does not send output to other member
neurons, is not found in these CPGs. In this paper we investigate a possible

composed of model neurons which exhibit regular membrane voltage oscillations,
open topologies are essentially as able to maximize this functionality as
closed topologies. When we replace these models by neurons which exhibit
chaotic membrane voltage oscillations, the functional criterion selects closed
topologies when the demands of the task are increased, and these are the
topologies observed in known CPG networks. As isolated neurons from

The dysrhythmia, resulting from the co-existence of two pacemakers, the sinus

transitions from one pattern to another occurring abruptly. It is shown that
the parasystolic rhythm can be simulated by a model involving two oscillators

heart-rate variability as a result of heart denervation, the model predicts the
RR intervals with an error of less than 6% for an 80-beat sequence. From a

imposing simple generic features of proteins (low energy and compaction) on all
possible sequences we show that the structure space is sparse compared to the
sequence space. Even though the sequence space grows exponentially with N (the
number of amino acids) we conjecture that the number of low energy compact
structures only scales as ln N. This implies that many sequences must map onto
countable number of basins in the structure space. The number of sequences for
which a given fold emerges as a native structure is further reduced by the dual
requirements of stability and kinetic accessibility. The factor that determines
the dual requirement is related to the sequence dependent temperatures,
T_\theta (collapse transition temperature) and T_F (folding transition
temperature). Sequences, for which \sigma =(T_\theta-T_F)/T_\theta is small,
typically fold fast by generically collapsing to the native-like structures and
then rapidly assembling to the native state. Such sequences satisfy the dual
requirements over a wide temperature range. We also suggest that the functional
requirement may further reduce the number of sequences that are biologically
competent. The scheme developed here for thinning of the sequence space that
leads to foldable structures arises naturally using simple physical
characteristics of proteins. The reduction in sequence space leading to the
emergence of foldable structures is demonstrated using lattice models of
proteins.

sequences. First, a fractal record model of DNA sequence is proposed by mapping
DNA sequences to integer sequences, followed by R/S analysis of the model and
computation of the Hurst exponents. Second, we consider transition between the
four kinds of bases within DNA. The transition matrix analysis of DNA sequences
shows that some measures of complexity based on transition proportion matrix
are of interest. We use some measures of complexity to distinguish exon and

state are described as typical examples. Each element of the OR mixed state is
composed of corresponding memory pattern elements by means of the OR-operation.
The other two types are similarly defined. By analyzing their stabilities
through the SCSNA and the computer simulation, we found that the storage
capacity of the OR mixed state diverges in the sparse limit, but that the other
states do not diverge. In addition, we found that the optimal threshold values,
which maximize the storage capacity, for the memory pattern and the OR mixed
state coincide with each other in the spare limit. Thus, we conclude that the
OR mixed state is a reasonable representative of the mixed state in the spare

as epileptic seizures, lies on the characterisation of the dynamics of the
neural networks. The theory of non-linear dynamics provides signal analysis
techniques which may give new information on the behaviour of such networks.
Methods: We calculated correlation dimension maps for 19-channel EEG data from
3 patients with a total of 7 absence seizures. The signals were analysed
before, during and after the seizures. Phase randomised surrogate data was used
to test chaos. Results: In the seizures of two patients we could distinguish
two dynamical regions on the cerebral cortex, one that seemed to exhibit chaos
whereas the other seemed to exhibit noise. The pattern shown is essentially the
same for seizures triggered by hyperventilation, but differ for seizures
triggered by light flashes. The chaotic dynamics that one seems to observe is
determined by a small number of variables and has low complexity. On the other
hand, in the seizures of another patient no chaotic region was found. Before
and during the seizures no chaos was found either, in all cases. Conclusions:
The application of non-linear signal analysis revealed the existence of
differences in the spatial dynamics associated to absence seizures. This may
contribute to the understanding of those seizures and be of assistance in
clinical diagnosis.

a structural artifact, but of pure biological advantage. The possibility of the
existence of a phenomenon of a special mode of interaction, labeled as ""chiral
interaction"" (CI), for which structural chirality is a necessary condition, is
the main reason for such an advantage. In order to demonstrate such a
possibility, macroscopic chiral devices are introduced and presented as
analogies for such an interaction. For this purpose it is important to make a
clear distinction between geometric and physical chiralities, where the latter
are capable to perform chiral interactions with various media. Apart from
chirality, a few other structural elements are required. In particular, the
presence of an interface that separates between the chiral device and the
medium with which it is interacting. The physical chirality is build into this
very interface where chiral interaction is taking place. On a molecular level,
soluble proteins in particular, the active medium is the presence of random
ionic motion in the aqueous solvent. As a result of chiral interaction a
certain perturbation, or current, is generated and flowing along the coils of $
\alpha$-helix structure in one preferred direction out of two possible ones. A
model for such a chiral interaction is presented and a few significant
consequences are pointed out. In particular, it is important to emphasize the
time-irreversible feature of chiral interaction, which leads to its non-ergodic
nature that is to be considered a necessary condition for evolutionary
processes in biomolecules. There exists an experimental result by Careri et al.
who found a clear linkage between the free protonic motion in the hydration
layer of protein s and their enzymatic activity.

enhance CR in two different ways. In particular, when the coupling is strong
enough, the synchronization of the system is induced and optimized by the
noise. This synchronization leads to a high and wide plateau in the local
measure of coherence curve. The local-noise-induced limit cycle can evolve to a
refined spatiotemporal order through the dynamical optimization among the
autonomous oscillation of an individual neuron, the coupling of the network,
and the local noise.

decreasing with age. We show that a highly non uniform occupation can be

The recurrent excitatory-excitatory, inhibitory-inhibitory,
excitatory-inhibitory, and inhibitory-excitatory couplings are adopted. The
coupled, excitable HH neurons are assumed to receive the two kinds of
spike-train inputs: the transient input consisting of M impulses for the finite

a role of memory storage with on-off switching. When the coupling strength and
the time delay are changed, the distribution of the output ISI $T_{\rm o}$
shows bifurcation (multifurcation), metastability and chaotic behavior. The
calculation of the time correlation shows that the synchronization between the
two HH neurons is well preserved even when the distribution of their $T_{\rm

neutrality conditions by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We observe that
sequence space is traversed by neutral networks, i.e. sets of sequences with
the same fold connected by point mutations. Typical pairs of sequences on a
neutral network are nearly as different as randomly chosen sequences. The
fraction of neutral neighbors has strong sequence to sequence variations, which
influence the rate of neutral evolution. In this paper we study the
thermodynamic stability of different protein sequences. We relate the high
variability of the fraction of neutral mutations to the complex energy
landscape within a neutral network, arguing that valleys in this landscape are
associated to high values of the neutral mutation rate. We find that when a
point mutation produces a sequence with a new ground state, this is likely to
have a low stability. Thus we tentatively conjecture that neutral networks of
different structures are typically well separated in sequence space. This
results indicates that changing significantly a protein structure through a
biologically acceptable chain of point mutations is a rare, although possible,

equations acting on spatially continuous density distributions. It turns out
that quite contrary, taking into account the actual individual/discrete
character of the microscopic components of these systems is crucial for
explaining their macroscopic behavior. In fact, we find that in conditions in
which the continuum approach would predict the extinction of all the population
(respectively the vanishing of the invested capital or of the concentration of
a chemical substance, etc), the microscopic granularity insures the emergence
of macroscopic localized sub-populations with collective adaptive properties
which allow their survival and development. In particular it is found that in 2
dimensions ""life"" (the localized proliferating phase) always prevails.

either through stable intermediates or through a two-state process without
intermediates. The rather short folding times of the two-state process indicate
that folding is guided. We reconcile these two seemingly contradictory
observations quantitatively in a schematic model of protein folding. We propose
a new dynamical transition temperature which is lower than the thermodynamic
one, in qualitative agreement with in vivo measurement of protein stability
using E.coli. Finally we demonstrate that our framework is easily generalized

to the case of a long chain molecule. The problem involves the motion of a
chain molecule of $N$ segments across a region where the free energy per
segment is higher, so that it has to cross a barrier. We consider the limit
where the length of the molecule is much larger than the width of the barrier.
The width is taken to be sufficiently wide that a coninuum description is
applicable to even to the portion over the barrier. We use the Rouse model and
analyze the mechanism of crossing a barrier. There can be two dominant
mechanisms. They are: end crossing and hairpin crossing. We find the free
energy of activation for the hairpin crossing is two times that for end
crossing. In both cases, the activation energy has a square root dependence on
the temperature $T$, leading to a non-Arrhenius form for the rate. We also show
that there is a special time dependent solution of the model, which corresponds
to a kink in the chain, confined to the region of the barrier. The movement of
the polymer from one side to the other is equivalent to the motion of the kink
on the chain in the reverse direction. We also consider the translocation of
hydrophilic polypeptides across hydrophobic pores, a process that is quite
common in biological systems. Biological systems accomplish this by having a
hydrophobic signal sequence at the end that goes in first. We find that for
such a molecule, the transition state resembles a hook, and this is in
agreement with presently accepted view in cell biology.

analog electronic neurons (ENs). The ENs were designed to reproduce the
observed membrane voltage oscillations of isolated biological neurons from the
stomatogastric ganglion of the California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus.
The ENs are simple analog circuits which integrate four dimensional
differential equations representing fast and slow subcellular mechanisms that
produce the characteristic regular/chaotic spiking-bursting behavior of these
cells. In this paper we study their dynamical behavior as we couple them in the
same configurations as we have done for their counterpart biological neurons.
The interconnections we use for these neural oscillators are both direct
electrical connections and excitatory and inhibitory chemical connections: each
realized by analog circuitry and suggested by biological examples. We provide
here quantitative evidence that the ENs and the biological neurons behave
similarly when coupled in the same manner. They each display well defined
bifurcations in their mutual synchronization and regularization. We report
briefly on an experiment on coupled biological neurons and four dimensional ENs
which provides further ground for testing the validity of our numerical and
electronic models of individual neural behavior. Our experiments as a whole

arises and has many applications in computational biology and coding theory.
This problem has two versions: the Closest String problem and the Closest
Substring problem. Assume that we are given a set of strings ${\cal S}=\{s_1,
s_2, ..., s_n\}$ of strings, say, each of length $m$. The Closest String
problem asks for the smallest $d$ and a string $s$ of length $m$ which is
within Hamming distance $d$ to each $s_i\in {\cal S}$. This problem comes from
coding theory when we are looking for a code not too far away from a given set
of codes. The problem is NP-hard. Berman et al give a polynomial time algorithm
for constant $d$. For super-logarithmic $d$, Ben-Dor et al give an efficient
approximation algorithm using linear program relaxation technique. The best
polynomial time approximation has ratio 4/3 for all $d$ given by Lanctot et al
and Gasieniec et al. The Closest Substring problem looks for a string $t$ which
is within Hamming distance $d$ away from a substring of each $s_i$. This
problem only has a $2- \frac{2}{2|\Sigma|+1}$ approximation algorithm
previously Lanctot et al and is much more elusive than the Closest String
problem, but it has many applications in finding conserved regions, genetic
drug target identification, and genetic probes in molecular biology. Whether
there are efficient approximation algorithms for both problems are major open
questions in this area. We present two polynomial time approxmation algorithms
with approximation ratio $1+ \epsilon$ for any small $\epsilon$ to settle both
questions.

and are based on ratio-dependent functional responses. The equations account
for competition for resources between members of the same species, and between
members of different species. Predators divide their total hunting/foraging
effort between the available prey species according to an evolutionarily stable
strategy (ESS). The ESS foraging behaviour does not correspond to the
predictions of optimal foraging theory. We use the population dynamics
equations in simulations of the Webworld model of evolving ecosystems. New
species are added to an existing food web due to speciation events, whilst
species become extinct due to coevolution and competition. We study the
dynamics of species-diversity in Webworld on a macro-evolutionary timescale.
Coevolutionary interactions are strong enough to cause continuous overturn of
species, in contrast to our previous Webworld simulations with simpler
population dynamics. Although there are significant fluctuations in species
diversity because of speciation and extinction, very large scale extinction
avalanches appear to be absent from the dynamics, and we find no evidence for
self-organised criticality.

where the database may contain repeat sequences, and may not necessarily
contain an exact match to the sample sequence. In terms of minimizing the
Hamming distance between the sample sequence and the database subsequences the

multiple simultaneous mutations appear necessary to create or modify these

The textbook rule is one gene for one enzyme. Thus, biochemical systems with

temporal correlations and functional relations within and between point
processes. This paper begins with a review of these quantities, their
interpretation and how they may be estimated. A discussion of how to assess the
statistical significance of features in these measures is included. In
addition, new work is presented which builds on the framework established in
the review section. This work investigates how the estimates and their error
bars are modified by finite sample sizes. Finite sample corrections are derived
based on a doubly stochastic inhomogeneous Poisson process model in which the
rate functions are drawn from a low variance Gaussian process. It is found
that, in contrast to continuous processes, the variance of the estimators
cannot be reduced by smoothing beyond a scale which is set by the number of
point events in the interval. Alternatively, the degrees of freedom of the
estimators can be thought of as bounded from above by the expected number of
point events in the interval. Further new work describing and illustrating a
method for detecting the presence of a line in a point process spectrum is also
presented, corresponding to the detection of a periodic modulation of the
underlying rate. This work demonstrates that a known statistical test,
applicable to continuous processes, applies, with little modification, to point
process spectra, and is of utility in studying a point process driven by a
continuous stimulus. While the material discussed is of general applicability
to point processes attention will be confined to sequences of neuronal action
potentials (spike trains) which were the motivation for this work.

lattices intercalated between lipid bilayer membranes in a lamellar stack.
These lamellar DNA-cationic-lipid complexes can in principle exhibit a variety
of equilibrium phases, including a columnar phase in which parallel DNA strands
from a 2D lattice, a nematic lamellar phase in which DNA strands align along a
common direction but exhibit no long-range positional order, and a possible new
intermediate phase, the sliding columnar (SC) phase, characterized by a
vanishing shear modulus for relative displacement of DNA lattices but a
nonvanishing modulus for compressing these lattices. We develop a model capable
of describing all phases and transitions among them and use it to calculate
structural properties of the sliding columnar phase. We calculate displacement

unusual $\exp(- {\rm const.} \ln^2 r)$ dependence on separation r. We
investigate the stability of the SC phase with respect to shear couplings

nematic phase. For models with interactions only between nearest neighbor
planes, we conclude that the SC phase is not thermodynamically stable.
Correlation functions in the nematic lamellar phase, however, exhibit SC

genetic codes differ from part-level genetic codes in which each discrete part
is coded independently. In general, a system-level genetic code requires coding
discrete interacting parts such as organs or proteins in an interdependent way.
Changing a single symbol or ""gene"" in a system-level genetic code affects two
or more parts in a coordinated way. System-level genetic codes provide a
plausible mechanism for evolution by leaps also known as systemic
macromutations or hopeful monsters without invoking an intelligent agent,
vitalistic forces, or new laws of physics. A system-level genetic code may
explain the rapid appearance of new forms of life in the fossil record such as
the Cambrian Explosion in which most invertebrate phyla appeared. A
system-level genetic code may explain the origin of complex integrative systems
of tightly coadapted proteins such as the blood coagulation cascade in which
the removal or structural modification of any single part breaks the system. It
is demonstrated that a simple system-level genetic code can, in principle, be
implemented using biochemical mechanisms similar or identical to the mechanisms
used by transposable elements, regulation of gene expression, and the adaptive
vertebrate immune system. It is further suggested that cancer in the body and
both normal and tumor cell lines cultured in vitro are caused by mutations of

active amplification of faint sounds is provided by a dynamical system which is
maintained at the threshold of an oscillatory instability. This concept can
account for the exquisite sensitivity of the auditory system and its wide

hair cells with characteristic frequencies which span the range of audibility.
Tension-gated transduction channels, which primarily serve to detect the motion
of a hair bundle, also tune each cell by admitting ions which regulate the
motor protein activity. By controlling the bundle's propensity to oscillate,
this feedback automatically maintains the system in the operating regime where
it is most sensitive to sinusoidal stimuli. The model explains how hair cells

networks, whereby gene products from a single network can act to control their
own expression or the production of protein in another network. Engineered
control of cellular function through the design and manipulation of such
networks lies within the constraints of current technology. Here we develop a

of noise on the formulation. We consider a single network derived from
bacteriophage $\lambda$, and construct a two-parameter deterministic model
describing the temporal evolution of the concentration of $\lambda$ repressor

naturally, and we show how the bistable regime is enhanced with the addition of
the first operator site in the promotor region. We then show how additive and
multiplicative external noise can be used to regulate expression. In the
additive case, we demonstrate the utility of such control through the
construction of a protein switch, whereby protein production is turned ``on''
and ``off'' using short noise pulses. In the multiplicative case, we show that
small deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large fluctuations in
the production of protein, and describe how these fluctuations can be used to
amplify protein production significantly. These novel results suggest that an
external noise source could be used as a switch and/or amplifier for gene

single-molecule manipulation techniques. A general elastic model for

the folding angle $\phi$ is introduced to characterize their deformations. The
mechanical property of long dsDNA molecules is then studied based on this
model, where the base-stacking interactions between DNA adjacent nucleotide
basepairs, the steric effects of basepairs, and the electrostatic interactions
along DNA backbones are taken into account. Quantitative results are obtained
by using path integral method, and excellent agreement between theory and the
observations reported by five major experimental groups are attained. The
strong intensity of the base-stacking interactions ensures the structural
stability of DNA, while the short-ranged nature of such interactions makes
externally-stimulated large structural fluctuations possible. The entropic
elasticity, highly extensibility, and supercoiling property of DNA are all
closely related to this account. The present work also suggests the possibility
that negative torque can induce structural transitions in highly extended DNA

of fixed APD. The number of observable nodes depended upon pacing rate and
tissue length. Differences in beat to beat conduction velocity values at steady
state were small. In the ectopic focus scenario, variable conduction velocity
was not required for induction of discrodant alternans. In both scenarios,
stability of node position was dependent upon electrotonic coupling. Other
mathematical models produced qualitatively similar results. We conclude that
spatial inhomogeneities of electrical restitution are not requiredd to produce
discordant alternans; rather, discordant alternans can arise dynamicaly from
interaction of APD and conduction veolocity resstitution with single site
pacing, or from APD restitution alone in two site pacing.

self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice, with contact interactions
between nearest neighbor pairs. For each pair, the interaction energy is an
independent Gaussian variable with mean value $B$ and variance $\D^2$. For this
model the annealed approximation is expected to become exact for low disorder,
at sufficiently high dimension and in the thermodynamic limit. We show that
corrections to the annealed approximation in the 3-d high temperature phase are
small, but do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit, and are in good agreement
with our replica symmetric calculations. Such corrections derive from the fact
that the overlap between two typical chains is nonzero. We explain why previous
authors had come to the opposite conclusion, and discuss consequences for the
thermodynamics of the model. Numerical results were obtained by simulating
chains up to length 1400 by means of the recent PERM algorithm, in the coil and
molten globular phases, well above the freezing temperature.

physicists, as well as experimentalists or simulationists. Physical principles
should have been both constraints and guide-lines for the evolution of living
systems over billions of years. One generally aims at clarifying what physical
principles, possibly new ones, are behind the phenomena of biological interest
and at understanding how they work within the entire biological world. In the
present talk we describe an example of such an effort.
  Since the discovery of `superprecipitation' by Szent-Gyorgyi's group in
1940's, it has been a long puzzle how an assemblage of actin filaments with
random orientation can contract in the presence of the two-headed myosin
molecules undergoing actin-activated ATP-hydrolysis reaction. It is widely
accepted that during the contraction the two-headed myosin mediates the
relative sliding of two actin filaments whose polarity directions are not
parallel but rather anti-parallel. But this fact solely does not account for
the shortening. We propose a dynamical model which, upon numerical simulation,
exhibits the shortening of an bundle of the actin filaments which are initially
dirstributed randomly both in space along a line and in polarity direction. In
the course of shortening several clusters of actins appears along the bundle.
The model also shows the sorting of the actin filaments according to their
polarity in the late stage. These findings are in accordance with the recent
experiment by Takiguchi.

long-range correlations can exhibit different time organization for the
magnitude and sign. We find that the magnitude series relates to the nonlinear

is anticorrelated and that both magnitude and sign series may have clinical
applications.

repulsive barrier to pore growth. While both of these effects lead to enhanced
membrane stability against vesiculation and pore growth, the repulsive barrier
arises from correlated fluctuations of the adsorbed cations and favors closure
of a pore. Finally, the addition of a small amount of multivalent anions can
reverse the membrane stabilization, providing an effective way to regulate
membrane stability.

description of reproductive isolation used is based on the classical Dobzhansky
model and its recently proposed multilocus generalizations. The dynamics of
parapatric speciation is modeled as a biased random walk with absorption
performed by the average genetic distance between the residents and immigrants.
If a small number of genetic changes is sufficient for complete reproductive
isolation, mutation and random genetic drift alone can cause speciation on the
time scale of 10-1000 times the inverse of the mutation rate. Even relatively
weak selection for local adaptation can dramatically decrease the waiting time
to speciation. The duration of parapatric speciation is shorter by orders of
magnitude than the waiting time to speciation. For a wide range of parameter
values, the duration of speciation is order one over the mutation rate. In
general, parapatric speciation is expected to be triggered by changes in the
environment.

generically leads to an increase in order or self-organization in the system
and to the phenomenon of orthogenesis. Additionally, it is shown that it
potentially leads to a more robust evolution circumventing some of the problems
of brittleness. The above points are supported by explicit, analytic results
associated with some simple one and two-locus models and also by some much more
complicated numerical simulations.

qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation
times $T$: $I_{\rm pred} (T)$ can remain finite, grow logarithmically, or grow
as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a
finite number of parameters, then $I_{\rm pred} (T)$ grows logarithmically with
a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast,
power--law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite
parameter (or nonparametric) models such as continuous functions with
smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive
information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning
theory and in the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics
and dynamical systems theory. Further, in the same way that entropy provides
the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and
plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of $I_{\rm pred} (T)$
provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time
series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in different problems

this to be a null hypothesis testable by empirical studies. We re-analyze data
sets for mammals and birds compiled by Heusner, Bennett and Harvey, Bartels,
Hemmingsen, Brody, and Kleiber, and find little evidence for rejecting
$\alpha=2/3$ in favor of $\alpha=3/4$. For mammals, we find a possible
breakdown in scaling for larger masses reflected in a systematic increase in
$\alpha$. We also review theoretical justifications of $\alpha=3/4$ based on
dimensional analysis, nutrient-supply networks, and four-dimensional biology.
We find that present theories for $\alpha=3/4$ require assumptions that render
them unconvincing for rejecting the null hypothesis that $\alpha=2/3$.

is proposed as the ``chaos hypothesis''. Two fundamental features of stem cell
systems - stochastic differentiation of stem cells and the robustness of a
system due to regulation of this differentiation - are found to be general
properties of a system of interacting cells exhibiting chaotic intra-cellular
reaction dynamics and cell division, whose presence does not depend on the
detail of the model. It is found that stem cells differentiate into other cell
types stochastically due to a dynamical instability caused by cell-cell
interactions, in a manner described by the Isologous Diversification theory.
This developmental process is shown to be stable not only with respect to
molecular fluctuations but also with respect to removal of cells. With this
developmental process, the irreversible loss of multipotency accompanying the
change from a stem cell to a differentiated cell is shown to be characterized
by a decrease in the chemical diversity in the cell and of the complexity of
the cellular dynamics. The relationship between the division speed and this
loss of multipotency is also discussed. Using our model, some predictions that
can be tested experimentally are made for a stem cell system.

characterized by {\em power-law growth of the predictive information} that are
qualitatively more complex than any of the systems that have been investigated
before. Further, we investigate numerically the learning of a nonparametric
probability density, which is an example of a problem with power-law
complexity, and show that the proper Bayesian formulation of this problem
provides for the `Occam' factors that punish overly complex models and thus
allow one {\em to learn not only a solution within a specific model class, but
also the class itself} using the data only and with very few a priori
assumptions. We study a possible {\em information theoretic method} that
regularizes the learning of an undersampled discrete variable, and show that
learning in such a setup goes through stages of very different complexities.
Finally, we discuss how all of these ideas may be useful in various problems in
physics, statistics, and, most importantly, biology.

and canonical Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of the systems tend to get
stuck in local metastable energy basins. A novel Monte Carlo algorithm is
developed to alleviate the problem of ``ergodicity breaking'' of the glassy
systems, in which the Markov process is driven by an explicitly analytic weight
factor with enhanced probability in both low- and high-energy regions. To
characterize the degree of puckering of the supercoiled DNA loops, a new
quantity of aplanarity is introduced as the shortest principal axis of
configurational ellipsoid of DNA. With the suggested Monte Carlo method, the
quantitative correlation between supercoiling degree and buckling of DNA is
attained. With supercoiling stress increasing, the conformational transition
from a circle to mono-, diplo- or triple interwound superhelical structure will
take place in a successive but decreasingly abrupt mode.

active synapses are reduced if mistakes are made, otherwise no changes occur
(negative feedback). The balancing of those two tendencies typically shapes a
synaptic landscape with configurations which are barely stable, and therefore
highly flexible. This allows for swift adaptation to new situations.
Recollection of past successes is achieved by punishing synapses which have
once participated in activity associated with successful outputs much less than
neurons that have never been successful. Despite its simplicity, the model can
readily learn to solve complicated nonlinear tasks, even in the presence of

algebraically with the problem size N, with an exponent $k\sim 1.4$.

theory for two forms of such vesicles. A model of lipids introduced by us
previously is applied to a system of ionizable, anionic lipid, and permanently
charged, cationic lipid. We calculate the pH at which the lamellar phase
becomes unstable with respect to an inverted hexagonal one, a value which
depends continuously on the system composition. Identifying this instability
with that displayed by unilamellar vesicles undergoing fusion, we obtain very
good agreement with the recent experimental data of Hafez et al., Biophys. J.
2000 79: 1438-1446, on the pH at which fusion occurs vs. vesicle composition.
We explicate the mechanism in terms of the role of the counter ions. This
understanding suggests that a system of a neutral, non lamellar forming lipid
stabilized by an anionic lipid would serve equally well for preparing tunable,
pH sensitive vesicles. Our calculations confirm this. Further, we show that
both forms of vesicle have the desirable feature of exhibiting a regime in
which the pH at instability is a rapidly varying function of the vesicle
composition.

that are used to synthesize amino acids from the genetic information of nucleic
acids. We propose the following theory: the differentiation of physiological
states of a cell allows for the different choice of enzymes, and this choice is
later fixed genetically through evolution. To demonstrate this theory, a
dynamical systems model consisting of the concentrations of metabolites,
enzymes, amino acyl tRNA synthetase, and tRNA-amino acid complex in a cell is
introduced and numerically studied. It is shown that the biochemical states of
cells are differentiated by cell-cell interaction, and each differentiated type
takes to use different synthetase. Through the mutation of genes, this
difference in the genetic code is amplified and stabilized. Relevance of this
theory to the evolution of non-universal genetic code in mitochondria is
suggested.
  The present theory for the evolution of genetic code is based on our recent
theory of isologous symbiotic speciation, which is briefly reviewed. According
to the theory, phenotypes of organisms are first differentiated into distinct
types through the interaction and developmental dynamics, even though they have
identical genotypes, and later with the mutation in genotype, the genotype also
differentiates into discrete types, while maintaining the `symbiotic'
relationship between the types. Relevance of the theory to natural as well as
artificial evolution is discussed.

relevance in diverse disciplines. A classic problem is the determination of the
optimal arrangement of spheres in three dimensions in order to achieve the
highest packing fraction; only recently has it been proved that the answer for
infinite systems is a face-centred-cubic lattice. This simply stated problem
has had a profound impact in many areas, ranging from the crystallization and
melting of atomic systems, to optimal packing of objects and subdivision of
space. Here we study an analogous problem--that of determining the optimal
shapes of closely packed compact strings. This problem is a mathematical
idealization of situations commonly encountered in biology, chemistry and
physics, involving the optimal structure of folded polymeric chains. We find
that, in cases where boundary effects are not dominant, helices with a
particular pitch-radius ratio are selected. Interestingly, the same geometry is
observed in helices in naturally-occurring proteins.

in the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic
Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and an action-reaction model for synaptic
plasticity. Our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just
after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus. The
information processing performance of the system is evaluated using so called
phi-divergences from statistics which quantify a dissimilarity between
probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental
limits in statistics and information theory (IT). We show that there exists a
set of parameters that can optimize several important phi-divergences
simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing
rate (QFR) of the spiral ganglion neuron. The optimal value of the QFR is
frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the
signal (for small amplitudes). Consequently, optimal processing according to
several standard IT criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if
the parameters are ``tuned'' to values that correspond to one and the same QFR.
This offers a new explanation for the QFR and can provide new insight into the
role played by several other parameters of the peripheral auditory system.

intrinsically more stable than the gene encoding the repressor. We develop a
mathematical formalism to predict the stability of such epigenetic states from

transition obtained from our simulation shows excellent agreement with
currently available experimental and molecular dynamics data. Based on insights
obtained from folding its smaller structural components, a possible folding
mechanism for crambin is proposed. We observe that the folding occurs via a
cooperative, first order-like process, and that many folding pathways to the
native state exist. One particular sequence of events constitutes a
``fast-folding'' pathway where kinetic traps are avoided. At very low
temperatures, a kinetic trap arising from the incorrect packing of sidechains
was observed. These results demonstrate that folding to the native state can be
observed in a reasonable amount of time on desktop computers even when an
all-atom representation is used, provided the energetics sufficiently stabilize
the native state.

proteins from the sequences of their amino acids is one of the most important
challenges in molecular biology. An essential ingredient to solve this problem
within coarse-grained models is the task of deducing effective interaction
potentials between the amino acids. Over the years several techniques have been
developed to extract potentials that are able to discriminate satisfactorily
between the native and non-native folds of a pre-assigned protein sequence. In
general, when these potentials are used in actual dynamical folding
simulations, they lead to a drift of the native structure outside the
quasi-native basin. In this study, we present and validate an approach to
overcome this difficulty. By exploiting several numerical and analytical tools
we set up a rigorous iterative scheme to extract potentials satisfying a
pre-requisite of any viable potential: the stabilization of proteins within
their native basin (less than 3-4 \AA$ $ cRMS). The scheme is flexible and is
demonstrated to be applicable to a variety of parametrizations of the energy
function and provides, in each case, the optimal potentials.

denaturation transition of DNA. The two strands are modeled as interacting
polymer chains. The attractive interactions, which mimic the pairing between
the four bases, are reduced to a single short range binding term. Furthermore,
base-pair misalignments are forbidden, implying that this binding term exists
only for corresponding (same curvilinear abscissae) monomers of the two chains.
We take into account the excluded volume repulsion between monomers of the two
chains, but neglect intra-chain repulsion. We find that the excluded volume
term generates an effective repulsive interaction between the chains, which
decays as $1/r^{d-2}$. Due to this long-range repulsion between the chains, the
denaturation transition is first order in any dimension, in agreement with
previous studies.

mechanical waves transmitted through DNA. The propagation of the waves is
strongly dependent on the shape of the DNA thus proteins that change the shape
of DNA can alter signal transmission. The overall effect is a method of signal
processing by DNA binding proteins that creates a ""cellular communications
network"".
  The propagation of small amplitude disturbances through DNA is treated
according to the mechanical theory of elastic rods. According to the theory
four types of mechanical waves affecting extension(compression), twist, bend or
shear can propagate through DNA. Each type of wave has unique characteristic
properties. Disturbances affecting all wave types can propagate independently
of each other. Using a linear approximation to the theory of motion of elastic
rods, the dispersion of these waves is investigated. The phase velocities of
the waves lies in the range 5-8 angstroms/ps using constants suitable for a
description of DNA. The dispersion of all wave types of arbitrary wave length
is investigated for a straight, twisted rod.
  Based on these findings, we propose all-atom numerical simulations of DNA to
investigate the propagation of these waves as an alternative measure of the
wave velocity and dispersion analysis.

  in the Grand Canonical Model","  In modern biology, one of the most important research problems is to
understand how protein sequences fold into their native 3D structures. To
investigate this problem at a high level, one wishes to analyze the protein
landscapes, i.e., the structures of the space of all protein sequences and
their native 3D structures. Perhaps the most basic computational problem at
this level is to take a target 3D structure as input and design a fittest
protein sequence with respect to one or more fitness functions of the target 3D
structure. We develop a toolbox of combinatorial techniques for protein
landscape analysis in the Grand Canonical model of Sun, Brem, Chan, and Dill.
The toolbox is based on linear programming, network flow, and a linear-size
representation of all minimum cuts of a network. It not only substantially
expands the network flow technique for protein sequence design in Kleinberg's
seminal work but also is applicable to a considerably broader collection of
computational problems than those considered by Kleinberg. We have used this
toolbox to obtain a number of efficient algorithms and hardness results. We
have further used the algorithms to analyze 3D structures drawn from the
Protein Data Bank and have discovered some novel relationships between such

proposed mechanism, general anesthetics perturb oxygen pathways in both
membranes and oxygen-utilizing proteins such that the availabilities of oxygen
to its sites of utilization are reduced which in turn triggers cascading
cellular responses through oxygen-sensing mechanisms resulting in general
anesthesia. Despite the general assumption that cell membranes are readily
permeable to oxygen, exiting publications indicate that these membranes are
plausible oxygen transport barriers. The present hypothesis provides a unified
framework for explaining phenomena associated with general anesthesia and
experimental results on the actions of general anesthetics. If verified by

local strong heating of a muscle tissue heat transfer in it exhibits
substantial anisotropy unexplained in the context of the standard diffusion
model. The observed temperature dynamics is also characterized by nonlinear
behavior as well as by a certain repeat reversibility. The latter means that
the time variations in the temperature of a cellular tissue undergoing repeated
acts of heating go in the same way at least approximately. We explain the
observed anomalous properties of heat transfer by suggesting the flow of the
interstitial liquid to appear due to nonuniform heating which, in turn, affects
the heat transfer. A possible mechanism responsible for this effect is
discussed.

on evolution: How can an exploration strategy adapt in such a way as to exploit
the information gained about the problem at hand? We first introduce an
integrated formalism of evolutionary search which provides a unified view on
different specific approaches. On this basis we discuss the implications of
indirect modeling (via a ``genotype-phenotype mapping'') on the exploration
strategy. Notions such as modularity, pleiotropy and functional phenotypic
complex are discussed as implications. Then, rigorously reflecting the notion
of self-adaptability, we introduce a new definition that captures
self-adaptability of exploration: different genotypes that map to the same
phenotype may represent (also topologically) different exploration strategies;
self-adaptability requires a variation of exploration strategies along such a
``neutral space''. By this definition, the concept of neutrality becomes a
central concern of this paper. Finally, we present examples of these concepts:
For a specific grammar-type encoding, we observe a large variability of
exploration strategies for a fixed phenotype, and a self-adaptive drift towards
short representations with highly structured exploration strategy that matches
the ``problem's structure''.

computes the averaged free energy over sequences, always assuming that it is
self-averaging -- a property well-established only if a system with quenched
disorder is macroscopic. By enumerating the states and energies of compact 18,
27, and 36mers on a simplified lattice model with an ensemble of random
sequences, we test the validity of the self-averaging approximation. We find
that fluctuations in the free energy between sequences are weak, and that
self-averaging is a valid approximation at the length scale of real proteins.
These results validate certain sequence design methods which can exponentially
speed up computational design and greatly simplify experimental realizations.

  amino acid frequencies","  How robust is the natural genetic code with respect to mistranslation errors?
It has long been known that the genetic code is very efficient in limiting the
effect of point mutation. A misread codon will commonly code either for the
same amino acid or for a similar one in terms of its biochemical properties, so
the structure and function of the coded protein remain relatively unaltered.
Previous studies have attempted to address this question more quantitatively,
namely by statistically estimating the fraction of randomly generated codes
that do better than the genetic code regarding its overall robustness. In this
paper, we extend these results by investigating the role of amino acid
frequencies in the optimality of the genetic code. When measuring the relative
fitness of the natural code with respect to a random code, it is indeed natural
to assume that a translation error affecting a frequent amino acid is less
favorable than that of a rare one, at equal mutation cost. We find that taking
the amino acid frequency into account accordingly decreases the fraction of
random codes that beat the natural code, making the latter comparatively even
more robust. This effect is particularly pronounced when more refined measures
of the amino acid substitution cost are used than hydrophobicity. To show this,
we devise a new cost function by evaluating with computer experiments the
change in folding free energy caused by all possible single-site mutations in a
set of known protein structures. With this cost function, we estimate that of
the order of one random code out of 100 millions is more fit than the natural
code when taking amino acid frequencies into account. The genetic code seems
therefore structured so as to minimize the consequences of translation errors
on the 3D structure and stability of proteins.

a measure of the relationships among the modes and governs their time

higher costs, effectively performing a quality control. The statistical
structure of signal usage is predicted to be of a generalised Boltzmann form
that penalises signals that are costly and sensitive to errors. This predicted
distribution of signal usage against signal cost has two main features: an
exponential tail required for cost efficiency and an underutilisation of the

These predictions are shown to correspond quantitatively to the experiments in

a constructive method for a knot ""energy"" using a Metropolis Monte Carlo
algorithm to minimize the length of rope needed to realize a given knot for a
rope of a fixed diameter. They called the resulting rendering of the knot the
""ideal"" configuration. They have found (i) that the 3-dimensional (3D) writhe
of the ideal configuration of a knot appeared, empirically, to be quantized;
(ii) empirically, the 3D writhe of the ideal configuration was additive over
composition of knots; and (iii) the 3D writhe of ideal configuration of
alternating knots (which have a projection in which crossings alternate between
over and under as one transverses the knot in a fixed direction) seems to be
equal, to 1*T + 3/7*(W-B), where T is the ""Tait number,"" and W and B are the
number of the white and black regions in the checkerboard coloring of the knot.
It is still not clear why properties i-iii might be true. Here I show that all
these empirical findings can be related to the fact that T and W-B can be
proven to be additive over composition of alternating knots. In particular, (1)
the 3D writhe of ideal configurations is likely only to be additive for
composition of alternating knots, and (2) remarkably, the geometrical structure
of all alternating (even prime) knots is determined by the three smallest
knots.

umbrella sampling to effectively explore the entire space. We find that while
excluded volume constraints reduce the size of conformational space by many
orders of magnitude, the number of allowed conformations is still large. An
average repacked conformation has 20% of its chi angles in a non-native state.
Interestingly, well-packed conformations, with up to 50% non-native chi's
exist. Entropy is distributed non-uniformly over positions, and we partially
explain the observed distribution using rotamer probabilities derived from the
pdb database. In spite of our finding that 65% of the native rotamers and 85%
of chi 1 angles can be correctly predicted on the basis of excluded volume
only, 95% of positions can accomodate more than 1 rotamer in simulation. We
estimate that in order to quench the sidechain entropy observed in the presence
of excluded volume interactions, other interactions (hydrophobic, polar,
electrostatic) must provide an additional stabilization of at least 0.6 kT per
residue in order to single out the native state.

as a zero-energy trajectory between two equilibria in an auxiliary classical
mechanical system. Finding it is similar to e.g. computing heteroclinic orbits

lattice models which capture the essence of the force-induced or mechanical DNA
unzipping transition. Besides yielding the whole equilibrium phase diagram in
the force vs temperature plane, which reveals the presence of an interesting
re-entrant unzipping transition for low T, these models enable us to
characterize the dynamics of the process starting from a non-equilibrium
initial condition. The thermal melting of the DNA strands displays a model
dependent time evolution. On the contrary, our results suggest that the
dynamical mechanism for the unzipping by force is very robust and the scaling
behaviour does not depend on the details of the description we adopt.

that the topological entropy of a stiff ring polymer with a fixed knot is

firing rates of N neurons and a set of p discrete stimuli has been analytically
evaluated, under the assumption that neurons fire independently of one another
to each stimulus and that each conditional distribution of firing rates is
gaussian. Yet real stimuli or behavioural correlates are high-dimensional, with
both discrete and continuously varying features.Moreover, the gaussian
approximation implies negative firing rates, which is biologically implausible.
Here, we generalize the analysis to the case where the stimulus or behavioural
correlate has both a discrete and a continuous dimension. In the case of large
noise we evaluate the mutual information up to the quadratic approximation as a
function of population size. Then we consider a more realistic distribution of
firing rates, truncated at zero, and we prove that the resulting correction,
with respect to the gaussian firing rates, can be expressed simply as a
renormalization of the noise parameter. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of
averaging the distribution across the discrete dimension, evaluating the mutual
information only with respect to the continuously varying correlate.

  Microarray Data","  Microarray data consists of mRNA expression levels of thousands of genes
under certain conditions. A difference in the expression level of a gene at two
different conditions/phenotypes, such as cancerous versus non-cancerous, one
subtype of cancer versus another, before versus after a drug treatment, is
indicative of the relevance of that gene to the difference of the high-level
phenotype. Each gene can be ranked by its ability to distinguish the two
conditions. We study how the single-gene classification ability decreases with
its rank (a Zipf's plot). Power-law function in the Zipf's plot is observed for
the four microarray datasets obtained from various cancer studies. This
power-law behavior in the Zipf's plot is reminiscent of similar power-law
curves in other natural and social phenomena (Zipf's law). However, due to our
choice of the measure of importance in classification ability, i.e., the
maximized likelihood in a logistic regression, the exponent of the power-law
function is a function of the sample size, instead of a fixed value close to 1
for a typical example of Zipf's law. The presence of this power-law behavior is
important for deciding the number of genes to be used for a discriminant
microarray data analysis.

  Representations: A Case Study of the Spike Process","  Finding a basis/coordinate system that can efficiently represent an input
data stream by viewing them as realizations of a stochastic process is of
tremendous importance in many fields including data compression and
computational neuroscience. Two popular measures of such efficiency of a basis
are sparsity (measured by the expected $\ell^p$ norm, $0 < p \leq 1$) and
statistical independence (measured by the mutual information). Gaining deeper
understanding of their intricate relationship, however, remains elusive.
Therefore, we chose to study a simple synthetic stochastic process called the
spike process, which puts a unit impulse at a random location in an
$n$-dimensional vector for each realization. For this process, we obtained the
following results: 1) The standard basis is the best both in terms of sparsity
and statistical independence if $n \geq 5$ and the search of basis is
restricted within all possible orthonormal bases in $R^n$; 2) If we extend our
basis search in all possible invertible linear transformations in $R^n$, then
the best basis in statistical independence differs from the one in sparsity; 3)
In either of the above, the best basis in statistical independence is not
unique, and there even exist those which make the inputs completely dense; 4)
There is no linear invertible transformation that achieves the true statistical
independence for $n > 2$.

planetary systems in the local Milky Way, including the important moderating

The events are particularly frequent for satellites of giant gas planets at
\gtrsim 5-10 AU distance from solar-type parent stars, or in the conventional

organisms as our model, and that jolts may lead to important real-time
evolutionary episodes if the jolt durations are longer than about a week,
corresponding to several hundred generation times, or much less if the

investigated. The extension of the region of physical parameters that we have

The low-frequency sub-dispersion depended on the cell length, while the
high-frequency one was independent of it. The cell shape effect was simulated
by an ellipsoidal cell model but the comparison between theory and experiment

It is found that the dielectric property of the cell membrane has only a minor

extinction event depends on the degree of competition among the species as well
as on the strength of that event. For instance, in the regime of high
competition the ecosystem diversity, given by the fraction of surviving

provided it is not too large, while in the less competitive regime the
diversity decreases linearly with the size of the event. In the case of large

molecules living in a two-dimensional lattice are investigated analytically in
the infinite diffusion or mean-field limit and through Monte Carlo simulations

hipercyclic replicators A which are capable of replicating via binary fission A
+ E --2A with production rates s as well as via catalytically assisted
replication 2A + E --3A with rate c. In addition, a molecule can degrade into
its source materials E with rate $\gamma$. In the asymptotic regime the
population can be characterized by the presence (active phase) and the absence
(empty phase) of replicators in the lattice. In both diffusion regimes, we find
that for small values of the ratio c/$\gamma$ these phases are separated by a
second-order phase transition which is in the universality class of the
directed percolation, while for small values s/$gamma$ the phase transition is
of first order. Furthermore, we illustrate the suitability of the dynamic Monte
Carlo method, which is based on the analysis of the spreading behaviour of a
few active cells in the center of an otherwise infinite empty lattice, to

macroions is studied. DNA winds around spheres to form beads-on-a-string
complexes resembling the chromatin 10 nm fiber. At small enough concentration
of spheres these ""artificial chromatin"" complexes are negative, while at large
enough concentrations of spheres the charge of DNA is inverted by the adsorbed
spheres. Charges of complexes stabilize their solutions. In the plane of
concentrations of DNA and spheres the phases with positive and negative
complexes are separated by another phase, which contains the condensate of
neutral DNA-spheres complexes. Thus when the concentration of spheres grows,
DNA-spheres complexes experience condensation and resolubilization (or
reentrant condensation). Phenomenological theory of the phase diagram of
reentrant condensation and charge inversion is suggested. Parameters of this
theory are calculated by microscopic theory. It is shown that an important part
of the effect of a monovalent salt on the phase diagram can be described by the
nontrivial renormalization of the effective linear charge density of DNA wound
around a sphere, due to the Onsager-Manning condensation. We argue that our
phenomenological phase diagram or reentrant condensation is generic to a large

rates are actually close to the so-called error threshold. This threshold is in
fact a critical point beyond which genetic information is lost through a
second-order phase transition, which has been dubbed the ``error catastrophe.''
Here we explore this phenomenon using a field theory approximation to the
spatially extended Swetina-Schuster quasispecies model [J. Swetina and P.
Schuster, Biophys. Chem. {\bf 16}, 329 (1982)], a single-sharp-peak landscape.
In analogy with standard absorbing-state phase transitions, we develop a
reaction-diffusion model whose discrete rules mimic the Swetina-Schuster model.
The field theory representation of the reaction-diffusion system is
constructed. The proposed field theory belongs to the same universality class
than a conserved reaction-diffusion model previously proposed [F. van Wijland
{\em et al.}, Physica A {\bf 251}, 179 (1998)]. From the field theory, we
obtain the full set of exponents that characterize the critical behavior at the
error threshold. Our results present the error catastrophe from a new point of
view and suggest that spatial degrees of freedom can modify several mean field
predictions previously considered, leading to the definition of characteristic
exponents that could be experimentally measurable.

Debye-Huckel or non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann. We place major emphasis on charge
inversion - a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a strongly charged particle,
called macroion, binds so many counterions that its net charge changes sign. We
discuss the universal theory of charge inversion based on the idea of a
strongly correlated liquid of adsorbed counterions, similar to a Wigner
crystal. This theory has a vast array of applications, particularly in biology
and chemistry; for example, the DNA double helix in the presence of positive
multivalent ions (e.g., polycations) acquires a net positive charge and drifts
as a positive particle in electric field. This simplifies DNA uptake by the
cell as needed for gene therapy, because the cell membrane is negatively
charged. We discuss also the analogies of charge inversion in other fields of
physics.

  Quasispecies Model of Biological Evolution","  ""Standard"" information theory says nothing about the semantic content of
information. Nevertheless, applications such as evolutionary theory demand
consideration of precisely this aspect of information, a need that has
motivated a largely unsuccessful search for a suitable measure of an ""amount of
meaning"". This paper represents an attempt to move beyond this impasse, based
on the observation that the meaning of a message can only be understood
relative to its receiver. Positing that the semantic value of information is
its usefulness in making an informed decision, we define pragmatic information
as the information gain in the probability distributions of the receiver's
actions, both before and after receipt of a message in some pre-defined
ensemble. We then prove rigorously that our definition is the only one that
satisfies obvious desiderata, such as the additivity of information from
logically independent messages. This definition, when applied to the
information ""learned"" by the time evolution of a process, defies the intuitions
of the few previous researchers thinking along these lines by being monotonic
in the uncertainty that remains after receipt of the message, but non-monotonic
in the Shannon entropy of the input ensemble. It then follows that the
pragmatic information of the genetic ""messages"" in an evolving population is a
global Lyapunov function for Eigen's quasi-species model of biological
evolution. A concluding section argues that a theory such as ours must
explicitly acknowledge purposeful action, or ""agency"", in such diverse fields
as evolutionary theory and finance.

transition temperatures are obtained by calculating the squared radius of
gyration, the root-mean-squared pair separation fluctuation, the specific heat,
the internal energy of the system, and the Lindemann disorder parameter. In
spite of the simplicity, the protein-like heteropolymers have shown a complex
set of protein transitions as observed in experimental studies. Starting from
high temperature, these transitions include a collapse transition, a
disordered-to-ordered globule transition, a folding transition, and a
liquid-to-solid transition. These transitions strongly depend on the
native-state geometry of the model proteins and the size of the bias gap. A
strong transition from the disordered globule state to the ordered globule
state with large energy change and a weak transition from the ordered globule
state to the native state with small energy change were observed for the large
gap models. For the small gap models no native structures were observed at any
temperature, all three beta-sheet proteins fold into a partially-ordered
globule state which is geometrically different from the native state. For small
bias gaps at even lower temperatures, all protein motions are frozen indicating
an inactive solid-like phase.

recently. This opens a wide field for the study of their topology, evolution,
and complex processes occurring in them. Such networks possess a rich set of
scaling properties. A number of them are scale-free and show striking
resilience against random breakdowns. In spite of large sizes of these
networks, the distances between most their vertices are short -- a feature
known as the ``small-world'' effect. We discuss how growing networks
self-organize into scale-free structures and the role of the mechanism of
preferential linking. We consider the topological and structural properties of
evolving networks, and percolation in these networks. We present a number of
models demonstrating the main features of evolving networks and discuss current
approaches for their simulation and analytical study. Applications of the
general results to particular networks in Nature are discussed. We demonstrate
the generic connections of the network growth processes with the general

investigate both the phenomena of stochastic resonance (SR) and coherence

focus is on the challenge how internal noise stemming from individual ion
channels does affect collective properties of the whole ensemble. We
investigate both an unperturbed situation with no applied stimuli and one in
which the membrane is stimulated externally by a periodic signal and additional
external noise. For the nondriven case, we demonstrate the existence of an
optimal size of the membrane patch for which the internal noise causes a most
regular spike activity. This phenomenon shall be termed intrinsic CR. In
presence of an applied periodic stimulus we demonstrate that the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exhibits SR vs. decreasing patch size, or vs.
increasing internal noise strength, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that
conventional SR vs. the external noise intensity occurs only for sufficiently
large membrane patches, when the intensity of internal noise is below its
optimal level. Thus, biological SR seemingly is rooted in the collective
properties of large ion channel ensembles rather than in the individual
stochastic dynamics of single ion channels.

spreading of infection of the Herpes Simplex Virus in corneal tissue are
investigated through the dynamic Monte Carlo method. The model takes into
account different cell susceptibilities to the viral infection, as suggested by
experimental findings. In a two-dimensional square lattice, the sites are
associated to two distinct types of cells, namely, permissive and resistant to
the infection. While a permissive cell becomes infected in the presence of a
single infected cell in its neighborhood, a resistant cell needs to be
surrounded by at least R>1 infected or dead cells in order to become infected.
The infection is followed by the death of the cells resulting in ulcers whose
forms may be dendritic (self-limited clusters) or amoeboid (percolating
clusters) depending on the degree of resistance R of the resistant cells as
well as on the density of permissive cells in the healthy tissue. We show that
a phase transition between these two regimes occurs only for R>=5 and, in
addition, that the phase-transition is in the universality class of the
ordinary percolation.

  Motility and Integrate-and-Firing Neurons","  In recent single-particle tracking (SPT) measurements on {\it Listeria
monocytogenes} motility {\em in vitro}, the actin-based stochastic dynamics of
the bacterium movement is analyzed statistically (Kuo and McGrath, 2000). The
mean-square displacement (MSD) of the detrended trajectory exhibit a linear
behavior; it has been suggested that a corresponding analysis for the Brownian
ratchet model (Peskin, Odell, & Oster, 1993) leads to a non-monotonic MSD. A
simplified version of the Brownian ratchet, when its motion is limited by the
bacterium movement, is proposed and analyzed stochastically. Analytical results
for the simple model are obtained and statistical data analysis is
investigated. The MSD of the stochastic bacterium movement is a quadratic
function while the MSD for the detrended trajectory is shown to be linear. The
mean velocity and effective diffusion constant of the propelled bacterium in
the long-time limit, and the short-time relaxation are obtained from the MSD
analysis. The MSD of the gap between actin and the bacterium exhibits an
oscillatory behavior when there is a large resistant force from the bacterium.
The stochastic model for actin-based motility is also mathematically equivalent
to a model for integrate-and-firing neurons. Hence our mathematical results
have applications in other biological problems. For comparison, a continuous
formalism of the BR model with great analytical simplicity is also studied.

and $M$ does the configuration obtained at level $n$ of $T$ typically contain
significant information on the root variable? This problem arose independently
in biology, information theory and statistical physics.
  For all $b$, we construct a channel for which the variable at the root of the
$b$-ary tree is independent of the configuration at level 2 of that tree, yet
for sufficiently large $B>b$, the mutual information between the configuration
at level $n$ of the $B$-ary tree and the root variable is bounded away from
zero. This is related to certain secret-sharing protocols.
  We improve the upper bounds on information flow for asymmetric binary
channels (which correspond to the Ising model with an external field) and for
symmetric $q$-ary channels (which correspond to Potts models).
  Let $\lam_2(M)$ denote the second largest eigenvalue of $M$, in absolute
value. A CLT of Kesten and Stigum~(1966) implies that if $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 >1$,
then the {\em census} of the variables at any level of the $b$-ary tree,
contains significant information on the root variable. We establish a converse:
if $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 < 1$, then the census of the variables at level $n$ of the
$b$-ary tree is asymptotically independent of the root variable. This contrasts
with examples where $b |\lam_2(M)|^2 <1$, yet the {\em configuration} at level

of neutral evolution with structural conservation. Our model also predicts that
the substitution rate can strongly fluctuate from one branch to another of the
evolutionary tree. The average sequence similarity within a neutral network is
close to the threshold of randomness, as observed for families of sequences
sharing the same fold. Nevertheless, some positions are more difficult to
mutate than others. We compare such structurally conserved positions to
positions conserved in protein evolution, suggesting that our model can be a
valuable tool to distinguish structural from functional conservation in
databases of protein families. These results indicate that a synergy between
database analysis and structurally-based computational studies can increase our
understanding of protein evolution.

the large connectivity fluctuations usually found in these networks strengthen
considerably the incidence of epidemic outbreaks. Scale-free networks, which
are characterized by diverging connectivity fluctuations, exhibit the lack of
an epidemic threshold and always show a finite fraction of infected
individuals. This particular weakness, observed also in models without
immunity, defines a new epidemiological framework characterized by a highly
heterogeneous response of the system to the introduction of infected

events that involve the rapid extinction of many species and recoveries the
assimilation of new ones. These are analyzed and classified in terms of the

the prime cause of recoveries. Another major cause of crashes is the extinction

linear DNA and a simple fold geometry are assumed to derive constants for the
higher order folding. The model predicts the correct order of magnitude for the
experimentally determined Young's and shear modulus of condensed chromatin.
Thus we have demonstrated that the elastic properties of DNA are the primary
determinant of the elastic properties of each folded state. The derived elastic
constants are then used to predict the speed of propagation of small amplitude
waves. It is shown that extension/compression, twist, bend or shear waves can
be excite in each folded state.

the jigsaw model. RNA, proteins, or similar organic molecules polymerized in a
dehydrated carbon-rich environment, on surfaces in a carbon-rich environment,
or in another environment where polymerization occurs. These polymers
subsequently entered an aqueous environment where they folded into compact
structures. It is argued that the folding of randomly generated polymers such
as RNA or proteins in water tends to partition the folded polymer into domains
with hydrophobic cores and matching shapes to minimize energy. In the aqueous
environment, hydrolysis or other reactions fragmented the compact structures
into two or more matching molecules, occasionally producing simple living
systems, also known as autocatalytic sets of molecules. It is argued that the
hydrolysis of folded polymers such as RNA or proteins is not random. The
hydrophobic cores of the domains are rarely bisected due to the energy
requirements in water. Hydrolysis preferentially fragments the folded polymers
into pieces with complementary structures and chemical affinities. Thus the
probability of producing a system of matched, interacting molecules in
prebiotic chemistry is much higher than usually estimated. Environments where
this process may occur are identified. For example, the jigsaw model suggests
life may have originated at a seep of carbonaceous fluids beneath the ocean.
The polymerization occurred beneath the sea floor. The folding and
fragmentation occurred in the ocean. The implications of this hypothesis for
seeking life or prebiotic chemistry in the Solar System are explored.

indication that the transition is first order. This transition has been
theoretically studied since the early sixties, mostly within an approach in
which the microscopic configurations of a DNA molecule are given by an
alternating sequence of non-interacting bound segments and denaturated loops.
Studies of these models neglect the repulsive, self-avoiding, interaction
between different loops and segments and have invariably yielded continuous
denaturation transitions. In this study we exploit recent results on scaling
properties of polymer networks of arbitrary topology in order to take into
account the excluded-volume interaction between denaturated loops and the rest
of the chain. We thus obtain a first-order phase transition in d=2 dimensions
and above, in agreement with experiments. We also consider within our approach
the unzipping transition, which takes place when the two DNA strands are pulled
apart by an external force acting on one end. We find that the unzipping
transition is also first order. Although the denaturation and unzipping
transitions are thermodynamically first order, they do exhibit critical
fluctuations in some of their properties. For instance, the loop size
distribution decays algebraically at the transition and the length of the
denaturated end segment diverges as the transition is approached. We evaluate
these critical properties within our approach.

internal and mechanical degrees of freedom of a semiflexible biopolymer chain,
we show that self-trapped internal excitations (such as amide-I vibrations in
proteins, base-pair vibrations in DNA, or polarons in proteins) may produce the
buckling and collapse instabilities of an initially straight chain. These
instabilities remain latent in a straight infinitely long chain, because the
bending of such a chain would require an infinite energy. However, they
manifest themselves as soon as we consider more realistic cases and take into
account a finite length of the chain. In this case the nonlinear localized
modes may act as drivers giving impetus to the conformational dynamics of
biopolymers. The buckling instability is responsible, in particular, for the
large-amplitude localized bending waves which accompany the nonlinear modes
propagating along the chain. In the case of the collapse instability, the chain
folds into a compact three-dimensional coil. The viscous damping of the aqueous
environment only slows down the folding of the chain, but does not stop it even
for a large damping. We find that these effects are only weakly affected by the
peculiarities of the interaction potentials, and thus they should be generic
for different models of semiflexible chains carrying nonlinear localized

requirement that analog variables must be processed leads inevitably to a

activities in a population as a linear combination of certain decoding
functions, with coefficients given by the N firing rates (generally with D <<
N). We show how the neuronal encoding process may be described by projecting a
set of complementary encoding functions on the probability density, and passing
the result through a rectifying nonlinear activation function. We show how both
encoders and decoders may be determined by minimizing cost functions that
quantify the inaccuracy of the representation. Expressing a given computation

  noncoding segments in a complete genome","  The coding and noncoding length sequences constructed from a complete genome
are characterised by multifractal analysis. The dimension spectrum $D_{q}$ and
its derivative, the 'analogous' specific heat $C_{q}$, are calculated for the
coding and noncoding length sequences of bacteria, where $q$ is the moment
order of the partition sum of the sequences. From the shape of the $% D_{q}$
and $C_{q}$ curves, it is seen that there exists a clear difference between the
coding/noncoding length sequences of all organisms considered and a completely
random sequence. The complexity of noncoding length sequences is higher than
that of coding length sequences for bacteria. Almost all $D_{q}$ curves for
coding length sequences are flat, so their multifractality is small whereas
almost all $D_{q}$ curves for noncoding length sequences are multifractal-like.
We propose to characterise the bacteria according to the types of the $C_{q}$
curves of their noncoding length sequences.

strong long-range correlation. For substrings with length K=8, the $D_{q}$
spectra of all organisms studied are multifractal-like and sufficiently smooth
for the $C_{q}$ curves to be meaningful. The $C_{q}$ curves of all bacteria

post-immunization maximum viremia were matched in nine of twelve cases; in
patients with double peaks of nearly equal amplitude the later peaks were
matched. Patients with single early peaks in their viremia were best fit with
relatively high antigen clearance rate constants, while patients with early and
late peaks in viremia of equal or nearly equal amplitude were best-fit with
much lower clearance rates. The rate of clearance may depend on the level of

represent the unique ground state; sequences associated with such structures
possess both robustness to mutation and thermodynamic stability. Here we report
that highly designable backbone conformations also emerge in a realistic

means of lattice Monte Carlo simulations using bond fluctuation algorithm and
by a numerical self-consistent field method. Copolymer chains of fixed length
with A and B monomeric units with regular, random and specially designed
(protein-like) primary sequences have been investigated. The dependence of the
transition temperature on the AB sequence has been analyzed. A protein-like
copolymer is more stable than a copolymer with statistically random sequence.
The transition is more sharpe for random copolymers. It is found that there
exist a temperature below which the chain appears to be in the lowest energy
state (ground state). Both for random and protein-like sequences and for
regular copolymers with a relatively long repeating block, a molten globule
regime is found between the ground state temperature and the transition
temperature. For regular block copolymers the transition temperature increases
with block size. Qualitatively, the results from both methods are in agreement.
Differences between the methods result from approximations in the SCF theory
and equilibration problems in MC simulations. The two methods are thus
complementary.

consequence of a finite genome size only, in the complete absence of backward
or compensatory mutations, epistasis, or recombination. The origin of this
effect lies in the fact that the number of loci at which mutations can create
considerable damage decreases with every turn of the ratchet, while the total
number of mutations per genome and generation remains constant. Whether the
ratchet will come to a halt eventually depends on the ratio of the per-locus
deleterious mutation rate $u$ and the selection strength $s$. For sufficiently
small $u/s$, the ratchet halts after only a few clicks. We discuss the
implications of our results for bacterial and virus evolution.

which the time window with the negative part as well as the positive part is
used to describe the biologically plausible synaptic plasticity. The learning
rule is applied to encode a number of periodical spatiotemporal patterns, which
are successfully reproduced in the periodical firing pattern of spiking neurons
in the process of memory retrieval. The global inhibition is incorporated into
the model so as to induce the gamma oscillation. The occurrence of gamma
oscillation turns out to give appropriate spike timings for memory retrieval of
discrete type of spatiotemporal pattern. The theoretical analysis to elucidate
the stationary properties of perfect retrieval state is conducted in the limit
of an infinite number of neurons and shows the good agreement with the result
of numerical simulations. The result of this analysis indicates that the
presence of the negative and positive parts in the form of the time window
contributes to reduce the size of crosstalk term, implying that the time window
with the negative and positive parts is suitable to encode a number of
spatiotemporal patterns. We draw some phase diagrams, in which we find various
types of phase transitions with change of the intensity of global inhibition.

distinct regimes depending on the chain length. The first regime well describes
the folding of small protein sequences and its kinetic counterpart appears to
be single exponential in nature, while the second regime is typical of
sequences longer than 80 amino acids and the folding performance achievable is
sensitive to target conformation. The extent to which stability, as measured by
the energy of a sequence in the target, is an essential requirement and affects
the folding dynamics of protein molecules in the first regime is investigated.
The folding dynamics of sequences whose design stage was restricted to a
certain fraction of randomly selected amino acids shows that while some degree
of stability is a necessary and sufficient condition for successful folding,
designing sequences that provide the lowest energy in the target seems to be a
superfluous constraint. By studying the dynamics of under annealed but
otherwise freely designed sequences we explore the relation between stability
and kinetic accessibility. We find that there is no one-to-one correspondence
between having low energy and folding quickly to the target, as only a small
fraction of the most stable sequences were also found to fold relatively
quickly.

be represented most sparsely (the so-called best sparsifying basis (BSB)) and
the one under which such a set becomes as less statistically dependent as
possible (the so-called least statistically-dependent basis (LSDB)) are
important for data compression and have generated interests among computational
neuroscientists as well as applied mathematicians. Here we consider these bases
for a particularly simple stochastic process called ``generalized spike
process'', which puts a single spike--whose amplitude is sampled from the
standard normal distribution--at a random location in the zero vector of length
$\ndim$ for each realization.
  Unlike the ``simple spike process'' which we dealt with in our previous paper
and whose amplitude is constant, we need to consider the kurtosis-maximizing
basis (KMB) instead of the LSDB due to the difficulty of evaluating
differential entropy and mutual information of the generalized spike process.
By computing the marginal densities and moments, we prove that: 1) the BSB and
the KMB selects the standard basis if we restrict our basis search within all
possible orthonormal bases in ${\mathbb R}^n$; 2) if we extend our basis search
to all possible volume-preserving invertible linear transformations, then the
BSB exists and is again the standard basis whereas the KMB does not exist.
Thus, the KMB is rather sensitive to the orthonormality of the transformations
under consideration whereas the BSB is insensitive to that. Our results once
again support the preference of the BSB over the LSDB/KMB for data compression
applications as our previous work did.

  X-ray studies of proteins","  Photoionisation of an atom by X-rays usually removes an inner-shell electron
from the atom, leaving behind a perturbed ""hollow ion"" whose relaxation may
take different routes. In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is
common. However, the energy and the total number of electrons released from the
atom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the inner-shell
electron leaves, the outer-shell electrons may find themselves in a state that
is not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective
excitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low
energy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off. It
is not clear how significant shake-up and shake-off contributions are to the
overall ionisation of biological materials like proteins. In particular, the
interaction between the out-going electron and the remaining system depends on
the chemical environment of the atom, which can be studied by quantum chemical
methods. Here we present calculations on model compounds to represent the most
common chemical environments in proteins. The results show that the shake-up
and shake-off processes affect about 20% of all emissions from nitrogen, 30%
from carbon, 40% from oxygen, and 23% from sulphur. Triple and higher
ionisations are rare for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, but are frequent for
sulphur. The findings are relevant to the design of biological experiments at
emerging X-ray free-electron lasers.

observe the formation of a network of active agents whose stability depends on

sequences. Each bit in the sequence arises from a partition of conformational

also used to characterize the regions of conformational space visited by the

simulation. Although not realized by nature, these ensembles can be implemented
on computers. In recent years generalized ensembles have in particular been
studied for the simulation of complex systems. For these systems it is typical
that conflicting constraints lead to free energy barriers, which fragment the
configuration space. Examples of major interest are spin glasses and proteins.
In my overview I first comment on the strengths and weaknesses of a few major
approaches, multicanonical simulations, transition variable methods, and
parallel tempering. Subsequently, two applications are presented: a new
analysis of the Parisi overlap distribution for the 3d Edwards-Anderson Ising
spin glass and the helix-coil transition of amino-acid homo-oligomers.

incubation times in infectious prion diseases. The central feature of our model
is that slow growth of misfolded protein-aggregates from small initial seeds
controls the `latent' or `lag' phase, whereas aggregate-fissioning and
subsequent spreading leads to an exponential growth or doubling phase. Such a
general framework can account for many features of prion diseases including the
striking reproducibility of incubation times when high doses are inoculated
into lab animals. Broad incubation time distributions arise for low infectious
dose, while our calculated distributions narrow to sharply defined onset times
with increased dose. We apply our distributions to epidemiological vCJD data
and extract estimates of incubation times.

  Exercise","  We study the heartbeat activity of healthy individuals at rest and during
exercise. We focus on correlation properties of the intervals formed by
successive peaks in the pulse wave and find significant scaling differences
between rest and exercise. For exercise the interval series is anticorrelated
at short time scales and correlated at intermediate time scales, while for rest
we observe the opposite crossover pattern -- from strong correlations in the
short-time regime to weaker correlations at larger scales. We suggest a
physiologically motivated stochastic scenario to explain the scaling
differences between rest and exercise and the observed crossover patterns.

of human heart rate typically follows a multi-scaling Zipf's law. The presence
or failure of a power law, as well as the values of the scaling exponents, are
personal characteristics depending on the daily habits of the subjects.
Meanwhile, the distribution function of the low-variability periods as a whole
discriminates efficiently between various heart pathologies. This new technique
is also applicable to other non-linear time-series and reflects these aspects
of the underlying intermittent dynamics, which are not covered by other methods
of linear- and nonlinear analysis.

dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles and mixed DMPC/C_(12)E_(8)
aggregates. The influence of sucrose concentration on phospholipid vesicles
size and polydispersity has been investigated by complimentary X-ray and
neutron scattering. Sucrose solutions decreased vesicle size and polydispersity
and increased a contrast between phospholipid membrane and bulk solvent
sufficiently for X-rays. 40% sucrose in H2O increased X-ray contrast by up to
10 times compared to pure H2O. The range of sucrose concentration 30%-40%
created the best experimental conditions for the X-ray small-angle experiment

properties of DNA as classical and tunneling of protons as quantum, and show
that the dynamics of the transitions admits of soliton like solutions whose
shape and size strongly depend on the structure of the double helix. In
particular, we have found that the set of discrete breathers can be drastically
modified by the interplay of the torsional and elastic constants. Our results
may have a bearing upon substitution mutagenesis within the framework of
Watson-Crick's approach, and in this respect the breather soliton could
describe conformations corresponding to point mutations. The numerical
simulation of soliton dynamics suggests that an initial distribution of base
pairs with low probability of mutation per pair but of a sufficiently large
number of base pairs involved, could move and gather around a site so as to
form a set of base pairs with high probability of mutation, for a period of
time approximately 1 musec. We suggest that the irradiation of DNA at
frequencies of the proton tunneling, that is in infra-red region, could cause
mutations.
