  Top Quark Detection","  The use of neural networks for signal vs.~background discrimination in
high-energy physics experiment has been investigated and has compared favorably
with the efficiency of traditional kinematic cuts. Recent work in top quark
identification produced a neural network that, for a given top quark mass,
yielded a higher signal to background ratio in Monte Carlo simulation than a
corresponding set of conventional cuts. In this article we discuss another
pattern-recognition algorithm, the binary decision tree. We have applied a
binary decision tree to top quark identification at the Tevatron and found it
to be comparable in performance to the neural network. Furthermore,
reservations about the ""black box"" nature of neural network discriminators do
not apply to binary decision trees; a binary decision tree may be reduced to a
set of kinematic cuts subject to conventional error analysis.

  asymmetric neural network model","  We study the long time behaviour of the transient before the collapse on the
periodic attractors of a discrete deterministic asymmetric neural networks
model. The system has a finite number of possible states so it is not possible
to use the term chaos in the usual sense of sensitive dependence on the initial
condition. Nevertheless, at varying the asymmetry parameter, $k$, one observes
a transition from ordered motion (i.e. short transients and short periods on
the attractors) to a ``complex'' temporal behaviour. This transition takes
place for the same value $k_{\rm c}$ at which one has a change for the mean
transient length from a power law in the size of the system ($N$) to an
exponential law in $N$. The ``complex'' behaviour during the transient shows
strong analogies with the chaotic behaviour: decay of temporal correlations,
positive Shannon entropy, non-constant Renyi entropies of different orders.
Moreover the transition is very similar to that one for the intermittent
transition in chaotic systems: scaling law for the Shannon entropy and strong
fluctuations of the ``effective Shannon entropy'' along the transient, for $k >
k_{\rm c}$.

in performing nonlinear system identification; however, because of their
discrete nature, their use in bifurcation analysis of continuous-time systems
is limited. This shortcoming can be avoided by embedding the neural networks in

on a recurrent network implementation. Here the algorithms and their

  Empirical Maps and Numerical Bifurcation Analysis","  We use nonlinear signal processing techniques, based on artificial neural
networks, to construct an empirical mapping from experimental Rayleigh-Benard
convection data in the quasiperiodic regime. The data, in the form of a
one-parameter sequence of Poincare sections in the interior of a mode-locked
region (resonance horn), are indicative of a complicated interplay of local and
global bifurcations with respect to the experimentally varied Rayleigh number.
The dynamic phenomena apparent in the data include period doublings, complex
intermittent behavior, secondary Hopf bifurcations, and chaotic dynamics. We
use the fitted map to reconstruct the experimental dynamics and to explore the
associated local and global bifurcation structures in phase space. Using
numerical bifurcation techniques we locate the stable and unstable periodic
solutions, calculate eigenvalues, approximate invariant manifolds of saddle
type solutions and identify bifurcation points. This approach constitutes a
promising data post-processing procedure for investigating phase space and
parameter space of real experimental systems; it allows us to infer phase space
structures which the experiments can only probe with limited measurement
precision and only at a discrete number of operating parameter settings.

at the cellular level. The only experimentally verified learning rule, Hebb's
rule, is extremely limited in its ability to train networks to perform complex
tasks. An identified cellular mechanism responsible for Hebbian-type long-term
potentiation, the NMDA receptor, is highly versatile. Its function and efficacy
are modulated by a wide variety of compounds and conditions and are likely to
be directed by non-local phenomena. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that
NMDA receptors are not essential for some types of learning. We have shown that
another neural network learning rule, the chemotaxis algorithm, is
theoretically much more powerful than Hebb's rule and is consistent with
experimental data. A biased random-walk in synaptic weight space is a learning
rule immanent in nervous activity and may account for some types of learning --
notably the acquisition of skilled movement.

extended to study finite-temperature effects. The typical volume of the space
of interactions is calculated for strongly-diluted networks as a function of
the storage ratio $\alpha$, temperature $T$, and the tolerance parameter $m$,
from which the optimal storage capacity $\alpha_c$ is obtained as a function of
$T$ and $m$. At zero temperature it is found that $\alpha_c = 2$ regardless of
$m$ while $\alpha_c$ in general increases with the tolerance at finite
temperatures. We show how the best performance for given $\alpha$ and $T$ is
obtained, which reveals a first-order transition from high-quality performance
to low-quality one at low temperatures. An approximate criterion for recalling,
which is valid near $m=1$, is also discussed.

Hebb rule, a variant of the familiar Hebb rule, are studied in the presence of
noise(finite temperature), when the number of stored patterns is finite and in
the limit that the number of neurons $N\rightarrow
  \infty$. The fact that different patterns enter the synaptic rule with
different weights changes the configuration of the free energy surface. For a
general choice of weights not all of the patterns are stored as {\sl global}
minima of the free energy function. However, as for the case of the usual Hebb
rule, there exists a temperature range in which only the stored patterns are
minima of the free energy. In particular, in the presence of a single extra
pattern stored with an appropriate weight in the synaptic rule, the temperature
at which the spurious minima of the free energy are eliminated is significantly
lower than for a similar network without this extra pattern. The convergence
time of the network, together with the overlaps of the equilibria of the
network with the stored patterns, can thereby be improved considerably.

mutual interplay of Anderson localization and superconductivity in strongly
disordered systems. We start with brief discussion of modern aspects of
localization theory including the basic concept of scaling, self-consistent
theory and interaction effects. After that we analyze disorder effects on
Cooper pairing and superconducting transition temperature as well as
Ginzburg-Landau equations for superconductors which are close to the Anderson
transition. A necessary generalization of usual theory of ``dirty''
superconductors is formulated which allows to analyze anomalies of the main
superconducting properties close to disorder-induced metal-insulator
transition. Under very rigid conditions superconductivity may persist even in
the localized phase (Anderson insulator).Strong disordering leads to
considerable reduction of superconducting transition temperature T_{c} and to
important anomalies in the behavior of the upper critical field H_{c2}.
Fluctuation effects are also discussed. In the vicinity of Anderson transition
inhomogeneous superconductivity appears due to statistical fluctuations of the
local density of states. We briefly discuss a number of experiments
demonstrating superconductivity close to the Anderson transition both in
traditional and high-T_{c} superconductors. In traditional systems
superconductivity is in most cases destroyed before metal-insulator transition.
In case of high-T_{c} superconductors a number of anomalies show that
superconductivity is apparently conserved in localized phase before it is
suppressed by strong enough disorder.

phases of Hopfield-type network models. The basic calculation is done for the
generalized version of the standard model introduced by Horner [1] and by
Perez-Vicente and Amit [2] which can exhibit low mean levels of neural
activity. For a mean activity $\bar a =1/2$ the Hopfield model is recovered. In
this case, surprisingly enough, we cannot confirm the well known one step
replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) result for the storage capacity which was
presented by Crisanti, Amit and Gutfreund [3] ($\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf
1RSB}}\simeq 0.144$). Rather, we find that 1RSB- and 2RSB-Ans\""atze yield only
slightly increased capacities as compared to the replica symmetric value
($\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf 1RSB}}\simeq 0.138\,186$ and $\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf

lie within the recently discovered reentrant phase [4]. We conjecture that in

Markov Models from data which is based on the general `model merging' strategy
(Omohundro 1992). The process begins with a maximum likelihood HMM that
directly encodes the training data. Successively more general models are
produced by merging HMM states. A Bayesian posterior probability criterion is
used to determine which states to merge and when to stop generalizing. The
procedure may be considered a heuristic search for the HMM structure with the
highest posterior probability. We discuss a variety of possible priors for
HMMs, as well as a number of approximations which improve the computational
efficiency of the algorithm. We studied three applications to evaluate the
procedure. The first compares the merging algorithm with the standard
Baum-Welch approach in inducing simple finite-state languages from small,
positive-only training samples. We found that the merging procedure is more
robust and accurate, particularly with a small amount of training data. The
second application uses labelled speech data from the TIMIT database to build
compact, multiple-pronunciation word models that can be used in speech
recognition. Finally, we describe how the algorithm was incorporated in an
operational speech understanding system, where it is combined with neural
network acoustic likelihood estimators to improve performance over
single-pronunciation word models.

no noise in the input layer there is, in the case of one step of repl! ica
symmetry breaking, a phase tra nsition to optimal learning at some finite
$\alpha$ for all levels of noise in the hidden layer. When noise is added to
the input layer the generalization behavior is similar to that of the
perceptron. For one step of replica symmetry breaking, in the realizable limit,
the values of the spinodal points found in this paper disagree with previously

field to investigate how quantum fluctuations affect the macroscopic behavior
of neural networks. When the number of embedded patterns is finite, the Trotter
decomposition reduces the problem to that of a random Ising model. It turns out
that the effects of quantum fluctuations on macroscopic variables play the same
roles as those of thermal fluctuations. For an extensive number of embedded
patterns, we apply the replica method to the Trotter-decomposed system. The
result is summarized as a ground-state phase diagram drawn in terms of the
number of patterns per site, $\alpha$, and the strength of the transverse
field, $\Delta$. The phase diagram coincides very accurately with that of the
conventional classical Hopfield model if we replace the temperature T in the
latter model by $\Delta$. Quantum fluctuations are thus concluded to be quite
similar to thermal fluctuations in determination of the macroscopic behavior of
the present model.

simulations based on the parameters for the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, and
with these simulations we investigate the technique of Principal Component
Analysis when applied specifically to spectra of low S/N. We relate the
objective principal components to features in the spectra and use a small
number of components to successfully reconstruct the underlying signal from the
low quality spectra. Using the principal components as input, we train an
Artificial Neural Network to classify the noisy simulated spectra into
morphological classes, revealing the success of the classification against the
observed $b_{\rm J}$ magnitude of the source, which we compare with alternative
methods of classification. We find that more than 90\% of our sample of normal
galaxies are correctly classified into one of five broad morphological classes
for simulations at $b_{\rm J}$=19.7. By dividing the data into separate sets we
show that a classification onto the Hubble sequence is only relevant for normal
galaxies and that spectra with unusual features should be incorporated into a
classification scheme based predominantly on their spectral signatures. We
discuss how an Artificial Neural Network can be used to distinguish normal and
unusual galaxy spectra, and discuss the possible application of these results

weights gets partitioned into a disordered multifractal by a set of $p=\gamma
N$ random input patterns. The multifractal spectrum $f(\alpha)$ can be
calculated analytically using the replica formalism. The storage capacity and
the generalization behaviour of the perceptron are shown to be related to
properties of $f(\alpha)$ which are correctly described within the replica
symmetric ansatz. Replica symmetry breaking is interpreted geometrically as a
transition from percolating to non-percolating cells. The existence of empty

results for binary couplings are corroborated by numerical studies.

  Peculiars are There ?","  The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has provided images of
galaxies at moderate and high redshifts and changed the scope of galaxy
morphologies considerably. It is evident that the Hubble Sequence requires
modifications in order to incorporate all the various morphologies one
encounters at such redshifts. We investigate and compare different approaches
to quantifying peculiar galaxy morphologies on images obtained from the Medium
Deep Survey (MDS) and other surveys using the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2
(WFPC2) on board the HST, in the I band (filter F814W). We define criteria for
peculiarity and put them to use on a sample of 978 galaxies, classifying them
by eye as either normal or peculiar. Based on our criteria and on concepts
borrowed from digital image processing we design a set of four purely
morphological parameters, which comprise the overall texture (or
``blobbiness'') of the image; the distortion of isophotes; the filling-factor
of isophotes; and the skeleta of detected structures. We also examine the
parameters suggested by Abraham et al. (1995). An artificial neural network
(ANN) is trained to distinguish between normal and peculiar galaxies. While the
majority of peculiar galaxies are disk-dominated, we also find evidence for a
significant population of bulge-dominated peculiars. Consequently, peculiar
galaxies do not all form a ``natural'' continuation of the Hubble sequence
beyond the late spirals and the irregulars. The trained neural network is
applied to a second, larger sample of 1999 WFPC2 images and its probabilistic
capabilities are used to estimate the frequency of peculiar galaxies at
moderate redshifts as $35 \pm 15 %$.

particles produced in heavy ion reactions. In contradistinction to former
approaches the rescattering is done explicitly and not in a perturbative
fashion. We present a comparison of our calculations for the system
Ni(1.93AGeV)+Ni with recent data of the FOPI collaboration. We find that even
for this small system rescattering changes the observables considerably but
does not invalidate the role of the kaons as a messenger from the high density
zone. We cannot confirm the conjecture that the kaon flow can be of use for the
determination of the optical potential of the kaon.

investigated by analysing the spectral fluctuations of the energy spectrum. Our
results suggest that the initial symmetries (orthogonal, unitary and
symplectic) are broken by the disorder at the critical point. The critical
behaviour, determinedby the symmetry at the critical point, should therefore be
independent of the previous invariances and be described by a ``super''
universality class. This result is strongly supported by the fact that we
obtain the same critical exponent $\nu \simeq 1.35$ in the three cases:
orthogonal, unitary and symplectic.

be self affine with a roughness exponent of $\zeta=1/2$. But in the usual
experimental case of mode I (tensile) cracks, local mode preference causes the
crack surface to be only logarithmically rough, quite unlike those seen in

time range of simulations is taken care of so that the system does not surmount
free-energy barriers between the pure states which are considered to diverge in
the thermodynamic limit. We simulate time evolutions of extensive energy of the
system, Parisi's overlap distribution function, auto-correlation and
clones-correlation functions, distribution functions of the two correlations,
and magnetization induced by the field applied after a certain waiting time.
The data simulated exhibit a rich variety of aging phenomena. Most of them can
be interpreted in a unified way, though qualitatively, by the scenario of
``growth of quasi-equilibrium domains'' which we will introduce in this work.
More surprisingly, they suggest strongly that a basin of attraction of one
dominant pure state spans almost an entire phase space of the system with a
common time-reversal symmetry.

glass, no order parameter, such as the Parisi overlap distribution, can be both
translation-invariant and non-self-averaging. The standard mean-field picture
of the EA spin glass phase can therefore not be valid in any dimension and at
any temperature. Further analysis shows that, in general, when systems have
many competing (pure) thermodynamic states, a single state which is a mixture
of many of them (as in the standard mean-field picture) contains insufficient
information to reveal the full thermodynamic structure. We propose a different
approach, in which an appropriate thermodynamic description of such a system is
instead based on a metastate, which is an ensemble of (possibly mixed)
thermodynamic states. This approach, modelled on chaotic dynamical systems, is
needed when chaotic size dependence (of finite volume correlations) is present.
Here replicas arise in a natural way, when a metastate is specified by its
(meta)correlations. The metastate approach explains, connects, and unifies such
concepts as replica symmetry breaking, chaotic size dependence and replica
non-independence. Furthermore, it replaces the older idea of non-self-averaging
as dependence on the bulk couplings with the concept of dependence on the state
within the metastate at fixed coupling realization. We use these ideas to
classify possible metastates for the EA model, and discuss two scenarios
introduced by us earlier --- a nonstandard mean-field picture and a picture
intermediate between that and the usual scaling/droplet picture.

the behavior of the supercooled state by quenching to temperatures below this

In this phase, the system is non-ergodic and evolves through a distribution of

  Using Artificial Neural Networks","  Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have
been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and
symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or
connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use
a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic
component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning
robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a
flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for
analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather
than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist
analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language
processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of
connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the
SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In
this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the
flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer,
and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of
noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat
representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language
than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the
fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a
flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an
overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.

information entropy, is calculated by analysis of the metastable (TAP) states.
This yields a well behaved thermodynamics of the dynamical transition. The
multitude of glassy states also implies an extensive difference between the

of a long-range periodic Josephson array. This model is characterized by two
parameters, the number of wires ($2N$) and the flux per unit strip ($\alpha$);
in the limit $N \to \infty$ and fixed $\alpha \ll 1$ the dynamics of the model
are described by the set of coupled integral equations, which coincide with
those for the $p=4$ disordered spherical model. Below the glass transition we
have solved these equations numerically in a number of different regimes. We
observe power-law ageing after a fast quench with an exponent that decreases
rapidly with temperature. After slow cooling to a not-too-low temperature, we
see ageing characterized by the appearance of a new time scale which has a
power law dependence on the cooling rate. By contrast if the array is cooled
slowly to very low temperatures the ageing disappears. The physical
consequences of these results in different cooling regimes are discussed for
future experiment. We also study the structure of the phase space in the low
temperature glassy regime. Analytically we expect an exponential number of
metastable states just below the glass transition temperature with vanishing
mutual overlap, and numerical results indicate that this scenario remains valid
down to zero temperature. Thus in this array there is no further subdivision of
metastable states. We also investigate the probability to evolve to different
states given a starting overlap, and our results suggest a broad distribution
of barriers.

both transiently chaotic neural networks (TCNN) and discrete-time recurrent
neural networks (DRNN) have chaotic structure. A significant property of TCNN
and DRNN is that they have only one fixed point, when absolute values of the
self-feedback connection weights in TCNN and the difference time in DRNN are
sufficiently large. We show that this unique fixed point can actually evolve
into a snap-back repeller which generates chaotic structure, if several
conditions are satisfied. On the other hand, by using the Lyapunov functions,
we also derive sufficient conditions on asymptotical stability for symmetrical
versions of both TCNN and DRNN, under which TCNN and DRNN asymptotically
converge to a fixed point. Furthermore, generic bifurcations are also
considered in this paper. Since both of TCNN and DRNN are not special but
simple and general, the obtained theoretical results hold for a wide class of
discrete-time neural networks. To demonstrate the theoretical results of this
paper better, several numerical simulations are provided as illustrating
examples.

  Chaos","  We propose a neural network model with transient chaos, or a transiently
chaotic neural network (TCNN) as an approximation method for combinatorial
optimization problem, by introducing transiently chaotic dynamics into neural
networks. Unlike conventional neural networks only with point attractors, the
proposed neural network has richer and more flexible dynamics, so that it can
be expected to have higher ability of searching for globally optimal or
near-optimal solutions. A significant property of this model is that the
chaotic neurodynamics is temporarily generated for searching and
self-organizing, and eventually vanishes with autonomous decreasing of a
bifurcation parameter corresponding to the ""temperature"" in usual annealing
process. Therefore, the neural network gradually approaches, through the
transient chaos, to dynamical structure similar to such conventional models as
the Hopfield neural network which converges to a stable equilibrium point.
Since the optimization process of the transiently chaotic neural network is
similar to simulated annealing, not in a stochastic way but in a
deterministically chaotic way, the new method is regarded as chaotic simulated
annealing (CSA). Fundamental characteristics of the transiently chaotic
neurodynamics are numerically investigated with examples of a single neuron
model and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Moreover, a maintenance
scheduling problem for generators in a practical power system is also analysed
to verify practical efficiency of this new method.

appear. 3)A few lowest minima become thermodynamically dominant below T_K,
where the polymer is totally frozen. In the temperature range between T_A and
T_K, barriers between metastable states are shown to grow with decreasing
temperature suggesting super-Arrhenius behavior in a sufficiently large system.
Due to evolutionary constraints on fast folding, the folding temperature T_F is
expected to be higher than T_K, but may or may not be higher than T_A. Diverse
scenarios of the folding kinetics are discussed based on phase diagrams that
take into account the dynamical transition, as well as the static ones.

detail. The modification of the spin glass phase due to the presence of the

investigated. The onset of spin glass order leads to a plateau--like flattening
in the temperature dependence of the MP energy at low temperatures. It is found
that solutions of spin glass equations are needed to optimally fit the
experimental data of the temperature dependence of the exciton magnetic polaron

  Using Artificial Neural Networks","  In this paper, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust
processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat
analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing
an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than
using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist
analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language
processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of
connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the
SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis.
  In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture,
the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech
recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the
influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that
flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken
language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the
fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a
flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an
overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.

correpondences we demonstrate that both cases can be described in terms
familiar from theories of noninteracting particles. In particular, these two

conductance $g_2$. For an attractive or repulsive Hubbard interaction and
starting from a certain effective Hamiltonian we derive a supersymmetric

found by Efetov for noninteracting electrons in disordered metals. This enables
us to describe the diffusive motion of the particle pair on scales exceeding
the one-particle localization length $L_1$ and to discuss the corresponding
level statistics. For tightly bound pairs in one dimension, on the other hand,
we follow early work by Dorokhov and exploit the analogy with the transfer

completely independent of the dipolar forces. These systems spontaneously
develop long-range ferroelectric order at nonzero temperature despite the
absence of any fined-tuned short-range spatial correlations favoring dipolar
order. Furthermore, since this is a nonequilibrium model we find that the
paraelectric to ferroelectric transition depends on the particle mass. For the
XY and XYZ models, the critical temperatures extrapolate to zero as the mass of
the particle becomes infinite, whereas, for the Ising model the critical
temperature is almost independent of mass and coincides with the ferroelectric
transition found for the randomly frozen system at the same density. Thus in
the infinite mass limit the results of the frozen amorphous systems are
recovered.

random entries and a GUE. The relative strength of the two contributions is
determined by a parameter $\lambda$ suitably defined on the unfolded scale.
Using results for the spectral two-point correlator of this model obtained in
the framework of the supersymmetry method we focus attention on two different
regimes. For $\lambda$ << 1 the correlations are given by Dawson's integral
while for $\lambda$ >> 1 we derive a novel analytical formula for the two-point

at which deviations from pure GUE behavior become noticable can be identified.
We also derive an exact expansion of the local level density for finite level

  shape in quantum dots","  We study fluctuations of the local density of states (LDOS) on a tree-like
lattice with large branching number $m$. The average form of the local spectral
function (at given value of the random potential in the observation point)
shows a crossover from the Lorentzian to semicircular form at $\alpha\sim 1/m$,
where $\alpha= (V/W)^2$, $V$ is the typical value of the hopping matrix
element, and $W$ is the width of the distribution of random site energies. For
$\alpha>1/m^2$ the LDOS fluctuations (with respect to this average form) are
weak. In the opposite case, $\alpha<1/m^2$, the fluctuations get strong and the
average LDOS ceases to be representative, which is related to the existence of
the Anderson transition at $\alpha_c\sim 1/(m^2\log^2m)$. On the localized side
of the transition the spectrum is discrete, and LDOS is given by a set of
$\delta$-like peaks. The effective number of components in this regime is given
by $1/P$, with $P$ being the inverse participation ratio. It is shown that $P$
has in the transition point a limiting value $P_c$ close to unity, $1-P_c\sim
1/\log m$, so that the system undergoes a transition directly from the deeply
localized to extended phase. On the side of delocalized states, the peaks in
LDOS get broadened, with a width $\sim\exp\{-{const}\log
m[(\alpha-\alpha_c)/\alpha_c]^{-1/2}\}$ being exponentially small near the
transition point. We discuss application of our results to the problem of the
quasiparticle line shape in a finite Fermi system, as suggested recently by

Rev. Lett. {\bf 78}, 515 (1997)], we point out that no ``consistent picture''
exists for the enhancement of the localization length $\lambda_2$ for two
interacting particles (TIP) proposed previously by Shepelyansky. In fact there
are at least 3 different proposals for the dependence of $\lambda_2$ on
interaction and disorder. Most analytical and numerical work following
Shepelyansky's original approach neglected the phase correlations inherent in
the interference phenomena of localization and thus appears at least
questionable. In our Letter, we avoided this problem. Our results based on the
transfer matrix method (TMM) led us to ``conclude that the TMM ... measures an
enhancement ... which is ... due to the finiteness of the systems ''. In
particular, we did not question the results of v. Oppen et al. reproduced in
the Comment. We also note that in our Letter we explored the limit of large
system size M and not the ``thermodynamic limit''. The latter implies of course
a finite particle density quite different from the TIP problem. In any case,
$\lambda_2$ does not correspond to ``extended states'', because it remains
finite and smaller than M. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
``scaling theory of localization'' for TIP.

the (closely related) likelihood that there are $N_s$ signals in the data. We
compare them with results obtained by starting off with a maximum entropy type

dynamics at a given temperature starting from an equilibrium configuration at a
different temperature is also discussed. In presence of multifurcation, we find

energy levels than usual aging. The relevance of the observed mechanisms for
real structural glasses is discussed, and some numerical simulations of a soft
sphere model of glass are presented.

superconductors in a random pinning potential.
  For the static case we review the prediction that the phase diagram of such
systems consists of a topologically ordered Bragg glass phase, with quasi long
range translational order, at low fields. This Bragg glass phase undergoes a
transition at higher fields into another glassy phase, with dislocations, or a
liquid. This proposition is compatible with a large number of experimental
results on BSCCO or Thalium compounds. Further experimental consequences of our
results and relevance to other systems will be discussed.
  When such vortex systems are driven by an external force, we show that, due
to periodicity in the direction transverse to motion, the effects of static
disorder persist even at large velocity. In $d=3$, at weak disorder, or large
velocity the lattice forms a topologically ordered glass state, the ``moving
Bragg glass'', an anisotropic version of the static Bragg glass. The lattice
flows through well-defined, elastically coupled, static channels. We determine
the roughness of the manifold of channels and the positional correlation
functions. The channel structure also provides a natural starting point to
study the influence of topological defects such as dislocations. In $d=2$ or at
strong disorder the channels can decouple along the direction of motion leading
to a ``smectic'' like flow. We also show that such a structure exhibits an
effective transverse critical pinning force due to barriers to transverse
motion, and discuss the experimental consequences of this effect.

is derived and analyzed with respect to the particle flux. It is found that the
applied electric field is screened nonlinearly. The relaxation field is
calculated completely quantum mechanically and up to any order in the applied
field. The classical limit is given in analytical form. In the range of weak
fields the deformation of the screening cloud is responsible for the
Debye-Onsager relaxation effect. The result beyond linear response presented
here allows to investigate a field regime where no screening cloud is present.
The descreening field is determined as a function of thermal energy density of
the plasma. For stronger fields the moving charge is accelerated by accumulated
opposite charges in front of the particle. This can be understood in analogue
to the accoustic Doppler effect. A critical field strength is presented up to
which value a thermalized plasma is possible. The range of applicability of the
treatment is discussed with respect to applied field strength and space
gradients.

ingredients are a set of Potts neurons for each request, with interactions
designed to minimize path lengths and to prevent overloading of network arcs.
The topological nature of the problem is conveniently handled using a
propagator matrix approach. Although the constraints are global, the
algorithmic steps are based entirely on local information, facilitating
distributed implementations. In the polynomially solvable single-request case
the approach reduces to a fuzzy version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The
approach is evaluated for synthetic problems of varying sizes and load levels,
by comparing with exact solutions from a branch-and-bound method. With very few
exceptions, the Potts approach gives legal solutions of very high quality. The
computational demand scales merely as the product of the numbers of requests,
nodes, and arcs.

quantum chaotic billiards in two and three dimensions is calculated. The model
incorporates surface roughness at a microscopic scale by randomly choosing the
atomic levels at the surface sites between -W/2 and W/2. Surface roughness
yields a mean free path l that decreases as L/W^2 as W increases, L being the
linear size of the system. But this diminution ceases when the surface layer
begins to decouple from the bulk for large enough values of W, leaving more or
less unperturbed states on the bulk. Consequently, the mean free path shows a
minimum of about L/2 for W of the order of the band width. Energy fluctuations
reflect the behavior of the mean free path. At small energy scales, strong
level correlations manifest themselves by small values of the number of levels
variance Sigma^2(E) that are close to Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in all cases.
At larger energy scales, fluctuations are below the logarithmic behavior of RMT
for l > L, and above RMT value when l < L.

  Can Be Less Than 2/d","  For phase transitions in disordered systems, an exact theorem provides a
bound on the finite size correlation length exponent: \nu_{FS}<= 2/d. It is
believed that the true critical exponent \nu of a disorder induced phase
transition satisfies the same bound. We argue that in disordered systems the
standard averaging introduces a noise, and a corresponding new diverging length
scale, characterized by \nu_{FS}=2/d. This length scale, however, is
independent of the system's own correlation length \xi. Therefore \nu can be
less than 2/d. We illustrate these ideas on two exact examples, with \nu < 2/d.
We propose a new method of disorder averaging, which achieves a remarkable
noise reduction, and thus is able to capture the true exponents.

probabilities is considered. It has previously been shown that in the version
of the model with random sequential updating, a phase transition occurs from a
low density inhomogeneous phase to a high density congested phase. Here the
steady states for both parallel (fully synchronous) updating and ordered
sequential updating are solved exactly and the phase transition shown to
persist in both cases. For parallel dynamics and forward ordered sequential
dynamics the phase transition occurs at the same density but for backward
ordered sequential dynamics it occurs at a higher density. In both cases the
critical density is higher than that for random sequential dynamics. In all the
models studied the steady state velocity is related to the fugacity of a Bose
system suggesting a principle of minimisation of velocity. A generalisation of
the dynamics where the hopping probabilities depend on the number of empty
sites in front of the particles, is also solved exactly in the case of parallel
updating. The models have natural interpretations as simplistic descriptions of
traffic flow. The relation to more sophisticated traffic flow models is
discussed.

discuss the interface problem in the random bond Ising ferromagnet, the random
field Ising model, the diluted antiferromagnet in an external field, the spin
glass problem, the solid-on-solid model with a disordered substrate and other
convex cost flow problems occurring in superconducting flux line lattices and
traffic flow networks. On the algorithmic side we present a concise
introduction to a number of elementary algorithms in combinatorial
optimization, in particular network flows: the shortest path algorithm, the
maximum-flow algorithms and minimum-cost-flow algorithms. We present a short
glance at the minimum weighted matching and branch-and-cut algorithms.

the empirical distribution of the price increments x(t+T) - x(t) of S&P Index
futures, for time scales T, ranging from a few minutes to a few days using
high-frequency price data. We show that while the variance increases linearly
with the timescale, the kurtosis exhibits anomalous scaling properties,
indicating a departure from the iid hypothesis. Study of the dependence
structure of the increments shows that although the autocorrelation function
decays rapidly to zero in a few minutes, the correlation of their squares
exhibits a slow power law decay with exponent 0.37, indicating persistence in
the scale of fluctuations. We establish a link between the scaling behavior and
the dependence structure of the increments : in particular, the anomalous
scaling of kurtosis may be explained by ""long memory"" properties of the square
of the increments.

elastic systems such as manifolds and periodic systems. Although these objects
look very similar and indeed share some underlying physics, periodic systems
constitute a class of their own with markedly different properties. We focus on
such systems, review the methods allowing to treat them, emphasize the shift of
viewpoint compared to the physics of manifolds and discuss their physics in
detail. As for the statics, periodicity helps the system to retain a
quasi-translational order and to be stable with respect to the proliferation of
free topological defects such as dislocations. A disordered periodic system
thus leads to a glass phase with Bragg peaks: the Bragg glass. On the other
hand, for driven lattices, transverse periodicity allows the system to retain
its glassy nature, leading to a moving glass phase. The existence of these two
phases has important theoretical and experimental consequences, in particular
for vortex physics in superconductors, the physical system which is mainly
focused here.

range pairwise interaction delocalizes the N-body states in the basis of the
one-particle Slater determinants, and the spectral rigidity of the N-body
spectrum. The maximum number g_N of consecutive levels exhibiting the universal
Wigner-Dyson rigidity (the Thouless number) is given as a function of the
strength U of the interaction for the bulk of the spectrum. In the dilute
limit, one finds two thresholds: When U<U_{c1}, there is a perturbative mixing
between a few Slater determinants (Rabi oscillations) and g_N \propto |U|^P <1,
where P=N/2 (even N) or (N+1)/2 (odd N). When U=U_{c1}, the level spacing
distribution exhibits a crossover from Poisson to Wigner, related to the
crossover between weak perturbative mixing and effective golden-rule decay, and
g_N \approx 1. Moreover, we show that the same U_{c1} signifies also the
breakdown of the perturbation theory in U. For U_{c1}<U<U_{c2}, the states are
extended over the energetically nearby Slater determinants with a non-ergodic
hierarchical structure related to the sparse form of the Hamiltonian. Above a
second threshold U_{c2}, the sparsity becomes irrelevant, and the states are
extended more or less ergodically over g_N consecutive Slater determinants. A
self-consistent argument gives g_N ~ U^{N/(N-1)}. We compare our predictions to
a numerical study of three spinless Fermions in a disordered cubic lattice.
Implications for the interaction-induced N-particle delocalization in real
space are discussed. The applicability of Fermi's golden rule for decay in this
dilute gas of ""real"" particles is compared with the one characterizing a
finite-density Fermi gas. The latter is related to the recently suggested
Anderson transition in Fock space.

different kinds of localized states. We have also analyzed the formation of

connected to $K$ input neurons chosen at random in the network. The synapses
are $n$-states variables which evolve in time according to Stochastic Learning

maintains the same dynamics whether it is engaged in computation or in learning
new memories, a very low probability of synaptic transitions is assumed. In the

  function","  We investigate the generalization ability of a perceptron with non-monotonic
transfer function of a reversed-wedge type in on-line mode. This network is
identical to a parity machine, a multilayer network. We consider several
learning algorithms. By the perceptron algorithm the generalization error is
shown to decrease by the ${\alpha}^{-1/3}$-law similarly to the case of a
simple perceptron in a restricted range of the parameter $a$ characterizing the
non-monotonic transfer function. For other values of $a$, the perceptron
algorithm leads to the state where the weight vector of the student is just
opposite to that of the teacher. The Hebbian learning algorithm has a similar
property; it works only in a limited range of the parameter. The conventional
AdaTron algorithm does not give a vanishing generalization error for any values
of $a$.We thus introduce a modified AdaTron algorithm which yields a good
performance for all values of $a$. We also investigate the effects of
optimization of the learning rate as well as of the learning algorithm. Both
methods give excellent learning curves proportional to ${\alpha}^{-1}$. The
latter optimization is related to the Bayes statistics and is shown to yield
useful hints to extract maximum amount of information necessary to accelerate
learning processes.

effective lower dimensional system is triggered by increasing temperature if
the phase coherence length gets shorter than the lattice spacing $a$. A similar
effect occurs in a magnetic field if the magnetic length $L_m$ becomes shorter
than $a(D_{||}/D_\perp)^\gamma$, where $\D_{||}/D_\perp$ is the ratio of the
diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the planes or chains.
$\gamma$ depends on the direction of the magnetic field, e.g. $\gamma=1/4$ or
1/2 for a magnetic field parallel or perpendicular to the planes in a quasi
two-dimensional system. We show that even in the limit of large magnetic field,
weak localization is not fully suppressed in a lattice system. Experimental

dynamic mean field theory which is valid for $N\to\infty$. Especially for the

predicted by replica theory or simulations is found. This discrepancy is
resolved by new simulations investigating the learning time dependence and

considered. These non-Hermitian models can appear as a result of computation
for models of statistical physics using transfer matrix technique or describe
non-equilibrium processes. Eigenenergies of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are not
necessarily real and a joint probability density function of complex
eigenvalues can characterize basic properties of the systems. This function is
studied using the supersymmetry technique and a supermatrix $\sigma$-model is
derived. The $\sigma$-model differs from already known by a new term. The
zero-dimensional version of the $\sigma$-model turns out to be the same as that
obtained recently for ensembles of random weakly non-Hermitian or asymmetric
real matrices. Using a new parametrization for the supermatrix $Q$ the density
of complex eigenvalues is calculated in $0D$ for both the unitary and
orthogonal ensembles. The function is drastically different in these two cases.

  Field","  The algorithm to calculate the generating function for the number of
``skeleton'' diagrams for the irreducible self-energy and vertex parts is
derived for the problems with Gaussian random fields. We find an exact
recurrence relation determining the number of diagrams for any given order of
perturbation theory, as well as its asymptotics for the large order limit.
These results are applied to the analysis of the problem of an electron in the
Gaussian random field with the ``white-noise'' correlation function. Assuming
the equality of all ``skeleton'' diagrams for the self-energy part in the given
order of perturbation theory, we construct the closed integral equation for the
one-particle Green's function, with its kernel defined by the previously
introduced generating function. Our analysis demonstrate that this
approximation gives the qualitatively correct form of the localized states
``tail'' in the density of states in the region of negative energies and is
apparently quite satisfactory in the most interesting region of strong
scattering close to the former band-edge, where we can derive the asymptotics
of the Green's function and density of states in the limit of very strong
scattering.

Using the SUSY technique, mean correlators are obtained as quantum mechanical

allowing an interpretation of the results in terms of simple properties of the

how the Liouville quantum mechanics approach can be extended to obtain the full

  systems: One-Particle Properties and Boundary Effects","  Quasi-one-dimensional spin-Peierls and spin-ladder systems are characterized
by a gap in the spin-excitation spectrum, which can be modeled at low energies
by that of Dirac fermions with a mass. In the presence of disorder these
systems can still be described by a Dirac fermion model, but with a random
mass. Some peculiar properties, like the Dyson singularity in the density of
states, are well known and attributed to creation of low-energy states due to
the disorder. We take one step further and study single-particle correlations
by means of Berezinskii's diagram technique. We find that, at low energy
$\epsilon$, the single-particle Green function decays in real space like
$G(x,\epsilon) \propto (1/x)^{3/2}$. It follows that at these energies the
correlations in the disordered system are strong -- even stronger than in the
pure system without the gap. Additionally, we study the effects of boundaries
on the local density of states. We find that the latter is logarithmically (in
the energy) enhanced close to the boundary. This enhancement decays into the
bulk as $1/\sqrt{x}$ and the density of states saturates to its bulk value on
the scale $L_\epsilon \propto \ln^2 (1/\epsilon)$. This scale is different from
the Thouless localization length $\lambda_\epsilon\propto\ln (1/\epsilon)$. We
also discuss some implications of these results for the spin systems and their
relation to the investigations based on real-space renormalization group
approach.

energies are not in midgap, even in the unitarity limit. This implies that,
generically, the states associated with impurities are broad resonances, not
true bound states. There is no impurity band in the usual sense of the phrase.
The wavefunctions of these resonances possess interesting anisotropies in real

conclude that the system of resonances produces no qualitative modifications to
the T-matrix theory with impurity averaging which is normally used to treat the
low-temperature transport of unconventional superconductors. However, users of

leads to better predictions. We illustrate our method by considering computer
generated periodic and chaotic time series. The ANN model developed gave
excellent quality of fit for the training and test sets as well as for
iterative dynamic predictions for future values of the two time series.
Further, computer experiments were conducted by introducing Gaussian noise of

rather surprising results that upto a limit introduction of noise leads to a

  We show that a four-loop perturbation theory calculation of the effective

the effective drift in our simulation and confirm the validity of the
``Einstein relation'' that expresses the equality of the renormalization
factors, induced by the random medium, for the effective drift and effective

previously only been confirmed for Gaussian random drift fields. The simulation
result, for our non-Gaussian drift model, is consistent with a previous
theoretical analysis showing the Einstein relation should remain true,

the transversel width $W=\exp(\lambda L^{1/3})$ is exponential in the
longitudinal length $L$, there can be a large number $\sim \exp L^{1/3}$ of
available wide states. This ``complexity'' causes a phase transition from a
high temperature phase where the polymer lies in the widest lane, to a glassy
low temperature phase where it lies in one of many narrower lanes. Starting
from a uniform initial distribution of independent polymers, equilibration up
to some exponential time scale induces a sharp dynamical transition. When the
temperature is slowly increased with time, this occurs at a tunable
temperature. There is an asymmetry between cooling and heating. The structure
of phase space in the low temperature non-equilibrium glassy phase is of a

the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ diverges at $T\to 0$ as $1/T\ln^2(1/T)$, and
the specific heat behaves as $C\propto 1/\ln^3(1/T)$. The predictions on
magnetic susceptibility are consistent with the most recent results of quantum
Monte Carlo simulations on doped ladders with randomly distributed impurities.
We also calculate the average staggered magnetic susceptibility induced in the
system by such defects.

symbols which constitutes the chromosome, or ``genotype'', and the products
which this sequence encodes --- the ``phenotype''. This interface can be
thought of as a ``computer''. In this case the chromosome is viewed as an
algorithm and the phenotype as the result of the computation. In general only a
small fraction of all possible sequences of symbols makes any sense for a given
computer. The difficulty of finding meaningful algorithms by random mutation is
known as the brittleness problem. In this paper we show that mutation and
crossover favour the emergence of an algorithmic language which facilitates the
production of meaningful sequences following random mutations of the genotype.
We base our conclusions on an analysis of the population dynamics of a variant
of Kitano's neurogenetic model wherein the chromosome encodes the rules for
cellular division and the phenotype is a 16-cell organism interpreted as a
connectivity matrix for a feedforward neural network. We show that an
algorithmic language emerges, describe this language in extenso, and show how
it helps to solve the brittleness problem.

shape and elastic properties are characterized by a radius of gyration exponent
$\nu$ and an anisotropy exponent $z$. We derive scaling laws for the radius of
gyration $R_G(L_\perp,L_y)$ (i.e. the average thickness) of the tubule about a
spontaneously selected straight axis and for the tubule undulations
$h_{rms}(L_\perp,L_y)$ transverse to its average extension. For phantom (i.e.
non-self-avoiding) membranes, we predict $\nu=1/4$, $z=1/2$ and
$\eta_\kappa=0$, exactly, in excellent agreement with simulations. For
membranes embedded in the space of dimension $d<11$, self-avoidance greatly
swells the tubule and suppresses its wild transverse undulations, changing its
shape exponents $\nu$ and $z$. We give detailed scaling results for the shape

functions, as well as the anomalous elasticity of the tubules. Finally we
present a scaling theory for the shape of the membrane and its specific heat

the weakly localized regime. We discuss several possibilities to generalize the
concept of Anderson localization to interacting electron systems such as the

physical quantities are calculated by numerically exact diagonalization. The
results indicate that single-particle excitations close to the Fermi energy

renormalization group-like argument enables to study scaling of the dip with
increasing length of the sample L; the RG mapping is calculated approximately
using the analytical results for small samples. For a horizontal surface we
found that the surface is only weakly pinned at the inhomogeneity; the dip
scales as a power law L^\gamma with \gamma= 0.58496. The value of the exponent
agrees with direct numerical simulations of the inhomogeneous single-step

by a fixed point with no quantum fluctuations. This fixed point also controls
the classical finite temperature phase transition in this model. Many critical

  Breathers","  The evolution towards equipartition in the $\beta$-FPU chain is studied
considering as initial condition the highest frequency mode. Above an
analytically derived energy threshold, this zone-boundary mode is shown to be
modulationally unstable and to give rise to a striking localization process.
The spontaneously created excitations have strong similarity with moving exact
breathers solutions. But they have a finite lifetime and their dynamics is
chaotic. These chaotic breathers are able to collect very efficiently the
energy in the chain. Therefore their size grows in time and they can transport
a very large quantity of energy. These features can be explained analyzing the
dynamics of perturbed exact breathers of the FPU chain. In particular, a close
connection between the Lyapunov spectrum of the chaotic breathers and the
Floquet spectrum of the exact ones has been found. The emergence of chaotic
breathers is convincingly explained by the absorption of high frequency phonons
whereas a breather's metastability is for the first time identified. The
lifetime of the chaotic breather is related to the time necessary for the
system to reach equipartition. The equipartition time turns out to be dependent
on the system energy density $\epsilon$ only. Moreover, such time diverges as

  The neural processing components belong to the class of Generalized Single

pre-processed with a non-linear transformation, and then presented in a
linearly separable form for subsequent processing by a single layer net. Such
networks offer advantages of functional transparency and operational speed.
  For our parser, the initial stage of processing maps linguistic data onto a
higher order representation, which can then be analysed by a single layer
network. This transformation is supported by information theoretic analysis.

amorphous solid state exhibit certain universal characteristics. Chief among
these are the fraction of particles that are randomly localized and the scaling
functions that describe the order parameter and (equivalently) the statistical
distribution of localization lengths for these localized particles. The purpose
of this Paper is to discuss the origins and consequences of this universality,
and in doing so, three themes are explored. First, a replica-Landau-type
approach is formulated for the universality class of systems that are composed
of extended objects connected by permanent random constraints and undergo
amorphous solidification at a critical density of constraints. This formulation
generalizes the cases of randomly cross-linked and end-linked macromolecular
systems, discussed previously. The universal replica free energy is
constructed, in terms of the replica order parameter appropriate to amorphous
solidification, the value of the order parameter is obtained in the liquid and
amorphous solid states, and the chief universal characteristics are determined.
Second, the theory is reformulated in terms of the distribution of local static
density fluctuations rather than the replica order parameter. It is shown that
a suitable free energy can be constructed, depending on the distribution of
static density fluctuations, and that this formulation yields precisely the
same conclusions as the replica approach. Third, the universal predictions of
the theory are compared with the results of extensive numerical simulations of
randomly cross-linked macromolecular systems, due to Barsky and Plischke, and
excellent agreement is found.

global smoothed eigenvalue correlations do reflect the presence of a gap, and

the existence of a tricritical point, separating a ""first-order"" regime,
characterized by a sudden global failure, from a ""second-order"" regime,
characterized by a divergence in the breaking rate. We show that a first-order
transition is an artifact of a (large enough) discontinuity put by hand in the
disorder distribution. Thus, in generic physical cases, a first-order regime is
not present. This result is obtained from a graphical method, which, unlike
Andersen at al.'s analytical solution, enables us to distinguish the various
classes of qualitatively different behaviors of the model.

  molecules.I. Translational degrees of freedom","  A molecular dynamics simulation is performed for a supercooled liquid of
rigid diatomic molecules. The time-dependent self and collective density
correlators of the molecular centers of mass are determined and compared with
the predictions of the ideal mode coupling theory (MCT) for simple liquids.
This is done in real as well as in momentum space. One of the main results is
the existence of a unique transition temperature T_c, where the dynamics
crosses over from an ergodic to a quasi-nonergodic behavior. The value for T_c
agrees with that found earlier for the orientational dynamics within the error
bars. In the beta- regime of MCT the factorization of space- and time
dependence is satisfactorily fulfilled for both types of correlations. The
first scaling law of ideal MCT holds in the von Schweidler regime, only, since
the validity of the critical law can not be confirmed, due to a strong
interference with the microscopic dynamics. In this first scaling regime a
consistent description within ideal MCT emerges only, if the next order
correction to the asymptotic law is taken into account. This correction is
almost negligible for q=q_max, the position of the main peak in the static
structure factor S(q), but becomes important for q=q_min, the position of its
first minimum. The second scaling law, i.e. the time-temperature superposition
principle, holds reasonably well for the self and collective density
correlators and different values for q. The alpha-relaxation times tau_q^(s)
and tau_q follow a power law in T-T_c over 2 -- 3 decades. The corresponding
exponent gamma is weakly q-dependent and is around 2.55. This value is in
agreement with the one predicted by MCT from the value of the von Schweidler
exponent but at variance with the corresponding exponent gamma

molecular liquid by means of a general class of time-dependent correlators
S_{ll'}^m(q,t) which explicitly involve translational (TDOF) and orientational
degrees of freedom (ODOF). The system is composed of rigid, linear molecules
with Lennard- Jones interactions. The q-dependence of the static correlators
S_{ll'}^m(q) strongly depend on l, l' and m. The time dependent correlators are
calculated for l=l'. A thorough test of the predictions of mode coupling theory
(MCT) is performed for S_{ll}^m(q,t) and its self part S_{ll}^{(s)m}(q,t), for
l=1,..,6. We find a clear signature for the existence of a single temperature
T_c, at which the dynamics changes significantly. The first scaling law of MCT,
which involves the critical correlator G(t), holds for l>=2, but no critical
law is observed. Since this is true for the same exponent parameter lambda as
obtained for the TDOF, we obtain a consistent description of both, the TDOF and
ODOF, with the exception of l=1. This different behavior for l \ne 1 and l=1
can also be seen from the corresponding susceptibilities
(chi'')_{ll}^m(q,omega) which exhibit a minimum at about the same frequency
omega_{min} for all q and all l \ne 1, in contrast to (chi'')_{11}^m(q,omega)
for which omega'_{min} approx 10 omega_{min} . The asymptotic regime, for which
the first scaling law holds, shrinks with increasing l. The second scaling law
of MCT (time-temperature superposition principle) is reasonably fulfilled for l
\ne 1 but not for l=1. Furthermore we show that the q- and (l,m)-dependence of
the self part approximately factorizes, i.e. S_{ll}^{(s)m}(q,t) \cong
C_l^{(s)}(t) F_s(q,t) for all m.

derived using the conformal mapping method. In the singular case, all
singularities of the conformal map are on the unit circle, and the map is a
degenerate Schwarz-Christoffel map. The equations of motion describe the
motions of these singularities. Despite the typical fractal-like outcomes of
Laplacian growth processes, the equations of motion are shown to be not
particularly sensitive to initial conditions. It is argued that the sensitivity
of this system derives from a novel cause, the non-uniqueness of solutions to
the differential system. By a mechanism of singularity creation, every solution
can become more complex, even in the absence of noise, without violating the
growth law. These processes are permitted, but are not required, meaning the
equation of motion does not determine the motion, even in the small.

multilayer perceptrons with non-overlapping receptive fields to the problem of
the influence of noise, concerning e.g. the input units and/or the couplings
between the input units and the hidden units of the second layer (='input
noise'), or the final output unit (='output noise'). Without output noise, the
output itself is given by a general, permutation-invariant Boolean function of
the outputs of the hidden units. As a result we find that the phase
transitions, which we found in the deterministic case, mostly persist in the
presence of noise. The influence of the noise on the position of the phase
transition, as well as on the behaviour in other regimes of the loading
parameter $\alpha$, can often be described by a simple rescaling of $\alpha$
depending on strength and type of the noise. We then consider the problem of
the optimal noise level for Gibbsian and Bayesian learning, looking on replica
symmetry breaking as well. Finally we consider the question why learning with
errors is useful at all.

  Kronig-Penney Chain of Active Potentials","  We report in this paper the analytical and numerical results on the effect of
amplification on the transmission and reflection coefficient of a periodic
one-dimensional Kronig-Penney lattice. A qualitative agreement is found with
the tight-binding model where the transmission and reflection increase for
small lengths before strongly oscillating with a maximum at a certain length.
For larger lengths the transmission decays exponentially with the same rate as
in the growing region while the reflection saturates at a high value. However,
the maximum transmission (and reflection) moves to larger lengths and diverges
in the limit of vanishing amplification instead of going to unity. In very
large samples, it is anticipated that the presence of disorder and the
associated length scale will limit this uninhibited growth in amplification.
Also, there are other interesting competitive effects between disorder and
localization giving rise to some nonmonotonic behavior in the peak of
transmission.

such a way as to make the mean and the variance of $log(1+R_4)$ diverge
independently with length with different exponents. As $L \to \infty$, these

both the pure state structure and the overlap structure of realistic spin
glasses should be relatively simple: in a large finite volume with
coupling-independent boundary conditions, such as periodic, at most a pair of
flip-related (or the appropriate number of symmetry-related in the non-Ising
case) states appear, and the Parisi overlap distribution correspondingly
exhibits at most a pair of delta-functions at plus/minus the self-overlap. This
rules out the nonstandard SK picture introduced by us earlier, and when
combined with our previous elimination of more standard versions of the mean
field picture, argues against the possibility of even limited versions of mean
field ordering in realistic spin glasses. If broken spin flip symmetry should
occur, this leaves open two main possibilities for ordering in the spin glass
phase: the droplet/scaling two-state picture, and the chaotic pairs many-state
picture introduced by us earlier. We present scaling arguments which provide a
possible physical basis for the latter picture, and discuss possible reasons

the lower level (cluster of a single spin) our approximation coincides with the

erratic dependence on temperature, one may expect the mean over the disorder to
produce a continuously varying ``quenched state''. The assumption of such
continuity in temperature implies that in the infinite volume limit the state
is stable under a class of deformations of the Gibbs measure. The condition is
satisfied by the Parisi Ansatz, along with an even broader stationarity
property. The stability conditions have equivalent expressions as marginal
additivity of the quenched free energy. Implications of the continuity
assumption include constraints on the overlap distribution, which are expressed
as the vanishing of the expectation value for an infinite collection of
multi-overlap polynomials. The polynomials can be computed with the aid of a
""real""-replica calculation in which the number of replicas is taken to zero.

  survive weak random phase fluctuations?","  Effective theories for random critical points are usually non-unitary, and
thus may contain relevant operators with negative scaling dimensions. To study
the consequences of the existence of negative dimensional operators, we
consider the random-bond XY model. It has been argued that the XY model on a
square lattice, when weakly perturbed by random phases, has a quasi-long-range
ordered phase (the random spin wave phase) at sufficiently low temperatures. We
show that infinitely many relevant perturbations to the proposed critical
action for the random spin wave phase were omitted in all previous treatments.
The physical origin of these perturbations is intimately related to the
existence of broadly distributed correlation functions. We find that those
relevant perturbations do enter the Renormalization Group equations, and affect
critical behavior. This raises the possibility that the random XY model has no
quasi-long-range ordered phase and no Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase
transition.

load for onset of crack motion are investigated both analytically and by
numerical simulations. Elasticity of the solid leads to long range stress
transfer along the crack front which is non-monotonic in time due to the
elastic waves in the medium. In the quasistatic limit with instantaneous stress
transfer, the crack front exhibits dynamic critical phenomenon, with a second
order like transition from a pinned to a moving phase as the applied load is
increased through a critical value. At criticality, the crack-front is
self-affine, with a roughness exponent $\zeta =0.34\pm 0.02$. The dynamic
exponent $z$ is found to be equal to $ 0.74\pm 0.03$ and the correlation length
exponent $\nu =1.52\pm 0.02$. These results are in good agreement with those
obtained from an epsilon expansion. Sound-travel time delays in the stress
transfer do not change the static exponents but the dynamic exponent $z$
becomes exactly one. Real elastic waves, however, lead to overshoots in the
stresses above their eventual static value when one part of the crack front
moves forward. Simplified models of these stress overshoots are used to show
that overshoots are relevant at the depinning transition leading to a decrease
in the critical load and an apparent jump in the velocity of the crack front
directly to a non-zero value. In finite systems, the velocity also shows
hysteretic behaviour as a function of the loading. These results suggest a
first order like transition. Possible implications for real tensile cracks are
discussed.

  Bose-Hubbard model in one and two dimensions","  I study the zero temperature phase transition between superfluid and
insulating ground states of the Bose-Hubbard model in a random chemical
potential and at large integer average number of particles per site. Duality
transformation maps the pure Bose-Hubbard model onto the sine-Gordon theory in
one dimension (1D), and onto the three dimensional Higgs electrodynamics in two
dimensions (2D). In 1D the random chemical potential in dual theory couples to
the space derivative of the dual field, and appears as a random magnetic field
along the imaginary time direction in 2D. I show that the transition from the
superfluid state in both 1D and 2D is always controlled by the random critical
point. This arises due to a coupling constant in the dual theory with replicas
which becomes generated at large distances by the random chemical potential,
and represents a relevant perturbation at the pure superfluid-Mott insulator
fixed point. At large distances the dual theory in 1D becomes equivalent to the
Haldane's macroscopic representation of disordered quantum fluid, where the
generated term is identified with random backscattering. In 2D the generated
coupling corresponds to the random mass of the complex field which represents
vortex loops. I calculate the critical exponents at the superfluid-Bose glass
fixed point in 2D to be \nu=1.38 and z=1.93, and the universal conductivity at
the transition \sigma_c = 0.26 e_{*}^2 /h, using the one-loop field-theoretic

calculated in both discrete and continuous time formalism. It is demonstrated
that the dynamical redistribution strategy results in a larger typical growth

near the percolation threshold. The paper also studies the experimental
realisations of temporal voltage fluctuations in these films. Both the
structure of the voltage oscillations against the magnetic field and the time
series of the electric ""noise"" possess a fractal pattern. With the help of the
fractal analysis procedure, the fluctuations observed have been shown to be
neither a noise with a large number of degrees of freedom, nor the realisations
of a well defined dynamic system. On the contrary the model of voltage
oscillations induced by the weak fluctuations of a magnetic field of arbitrary
nature gives the most appropriate description of the phenomenon observed. The
imaging function of such a transformation possesses a fractal nature, thus
leading to power-law spectra of voltage fluctuations even for the simplest

paper suggests a new universal mechanism of a ""1/f noise"" origin. It consists
in a passive transformation of any natural fluctuations with a fractal-type

boundaries is investigated. It is shown that the structures of the GBs satisfy
a thermodynamical criterion. The potential energy of silicon atoms is closely
related with a geometrical quantity -- tetragonality of their coordination with
their nearest neighbors. A crossover of the length of localization is observed.
To analyze the crossover of the length of localization of the single-electron
states and properties of conductance of the thin polycrystalline film at low
temperature, we use a two-dimensional Anderson localization model, with the
random one-site electron charging energy for a single grain (dot), random
non-diagonal matrix elements, and random number of connections between the
neighboring grains. The results on the crossover behavior of localization
length of the single-electron states and characteristic properties of
conductance are presented in the region of parameters where the transition from
an insulator to a conductor regimes takes place.

non linear for magnetic fields of the order of the inverse square root of the

depinning, the fraction of spins that are flipped by the proceeding avalanche
vanishes with the same exponent beta=5/36 as the infinite percolation cluster

the critical region decreases. Our numerical simulation data appear to reflect
a crossover behaviour to an exponent beta'=0 at zero disorder strength. The
conclusions of this paper strongly rely on analytical arguments. A scaling

studied by Monte Carlo in two models. Our results confirm predictions of
Aharony and Harris based on Renormalization group considerations. For an
Ashkin-Teller model with strong but irrelevant bond randomness we find that the
relative squared width, $R_X$, of $P(X)$ is weakly self averaging. $R_X\sim
l^{\alpha/\nu}$, where $\alpha$ is the specific heat exponent and $\nu$ is the
correlation length exponent of the pure model fixed point governing the

governed by a random fixed point, we find that $R_X$ tends to a universal
constant independent of the amount of dilution (no self averaging). However
this constant is different for canonical and grand canonical disorder. We study
the distribution of the pseudo-critical temperatures $T_c(i,l)$ of the ensemble
defined as the temperatures of the maximum susceptibility of each sample. We
find that its variance scales as $(\delta T_c(l))^2 \sim l^{-2/\nu}$ and NOT as

of this singularity $E^*=\case{1}{2}(E_Z + \sqrt{E_Z^2- \Delta^2})$ (where
$\Delta$ is BCS gap at $E_Z=0$) is universal. We found analytically the shape
of the DoS for different dimensionality of the system. For ultra-small grains
the singularity has the shape of the hard gap, while in higher dimensions it
appears as a significant though finite dip. The spin-orbit scattering, and the
orbital magnetic field suppress the singularity. Our results are qualitatively
consistent with recent experiments in superconducting films.

networks is presented, where a mean field formulation of the Bellman-Ford
method for the single unicast problem is used as a common platform for
developing algorithms for multiple unicast, multicast and multiple multicast
problems. The appealing locality and update philosophy of the Bellman-Ford
algorithm is inherited. For all problem types the objective is to minimize a
total connection cost, defined as the sum of the individual costs of the
involved arcs, subject to capacity constraints. The methods are evaluated for
synthetic problem instances by comparing to exact solutions for cases where
these are accessible, and else with approximate results from simple heuristics.
The computational demand is modest.

neutron diffraction, allowed us to establish two structural limits in liquid
water. These two limits are closely connected to the two known forms of
amorphous ice : the low density amorphous ice (LDA) and the high density
amorphous ice (HDA). In the present paper, we propose some interpretation of
our data in terms of a two level type model of water. This leads to show some
evidence of a liquid-liquid phase transition in liquid supercooled water. The
result looks in agreement with recent computer simulations that incorporate the
two forms of amorphous ice.

coupling function $f(x)$ have been considered. In the absence of precessing
frequencies and for odd-coupling functions there exists a Lyapunov functional
and the probability density evolves toward stable stationary states described
by an equilibrium measure. We have then proposed a family of exactly solvable
models with singular couplings which synchronize more easily as the coupling
becomes less singular. The stationary solutions of the least singular coupling
considered, $f(x)=$ sign$(x)$, have been found analytically in terms of
elliptic functions. This last case is one of the few non trivial models for
synchronization dynamics which can be analytically solved.

  Mean-Field Models of Heterogeneous Faults","  The statistics of earthquakes in a heterogeneous fault zone is studied
analytically and numerically in the mean field version of a model for a
segmented fault system in a three-dimensional elastic solid. The studies focus
on the interplay between the roles of disorder, dynamical effects, and driving
mechanisms. A two-parameter phase diagram is found, spanned by the amplitude of
dynamical weakening (or ``overshoot'') effects (epsilon) and the normal
distance (L) of the driving forces from the fault. In general, small epsilon
and small L are found to produce Gutenberg-Richter type power law statistics
with an exponential cutoff, while large epsilon and large L lead to a
distribution of small events combined with characteristic system-size events.
In a certain parameter regime the behavior is bistable, with transitions back
and forth from one phase to the other on time scales determined by the fault
size and other model parameters. The implications for realistic earthquake
statistics are discussed.

  Classification with Neural Networks and Principal Components Analysis","  We investigate the application of neural networks to the automation of MK
spectral classification. The data set for this project consists of a set of
over 5000 optical (3800-5200 AA) spectra obtained from objective prism plates
from the Michigan Spectral Survey. These spectra, along with their
two-dimensional MK classifications listed in the Michigan Henry Draper
Catalogue, were used to develop supervised neural network classifiers. We show
that neural networks can give accurate spectral type classifications (sig_68 =
0.82 subtypes, sig_rms = 1.09 subtypes) across the full range of spectral types
present in the data set (B2-M7). We show also that the networks yield correct
luminosity classes for over 95% of both dwarfs and giants with a high degree of
confidence.
  Stellar spectra generally contain a large amount of redundant information. We
investigate the application of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to the
optimal compression of spectra. We show that PCA can compress the spectra by a
factor of over 30 while retaining essentially all of the useful information in
the data set. Furthermore, it is shown that this compression optimally removes
noise and can be used to identify unusual spectra.

one-dimensional (1D) conductors have been studied in the vicinity of the
Thouless crossover. We find that on the weak localization (WL) side of the
crossover, these dependences are consistent with the theory of quantum
corrections to the resistance, and the phase breaking is due to the
quasi-elastic electron-electron interactions (the Nyquist noise). The
temperature dependence of the phase coherence time does not saturate, and the
quasiparticle states remain well defined over the whole WL temperature range.
This fact, as well as observation of the Thouless crossover in 1D samples,
argues against the idea of intrinsic decoherence by zero-point fluctuations of
the electrons (Mohanty et al., Phys.Rev.Lett. 78, 3366 (1997)). We believe that
frequently observed saturation of the phase coherence time is caused by the
external microwave noise.

antiferromagnet is studied. In the weak-disorder regime (W \le U), while the
energy gap decreases rapidly with disorder, the sublattice magnetization,
including quantum corrections, is found to remain essentially unchanged in the
strong correlation limit. Magnon energies and Neel temperature are enhanced by
disorder in this limit. A single paradigm of disorder-enhanced delocalization
qualitatively accounts for all these weak disorder effects. Vertex corrections
and magnon damping, which appear only at order (W/U)^4, are also studied. With
increasing disorder a crossover is found at W \sim U, characterized by a rapid
decrease in sublattice magnetization due to quenching of local moments, and
formation of spin vacancies. The latter suggests a spin-dilution behavior,
which is indeed observed in softened magnon modes, lowering of Neel
temperature, and enhanced transverse spin fluctuations.

critical exponents that are defined in terms of finite clusters have some
anomalous values as the critical point is approached from the high density side
which vindicates the results of earlier studies. In particular, the exponent
$\tilde \gamma^\prime$ which characterises the divergence of the average size
of finite clusters is 1/2 and $\tilde\nu^\prime$, the exponent associated with
the length scale of finite clusters is 1/4. The full collection of exponents
indicates an upper critical dimension of 6. The standard mean field exponents
of the Ising system are also present in this model ($\nu^\prime = 1/2$,
$\gamma^\prime = 1$) which implies, in particular, the presence of two
diverging length scales. Furthermore, the finite cluster exponents are stable
to the addition of disorder which, near the upper critical dimension, may have
interesting implications concerning the generality of the disordered
system/correlation length bounds.

low temperatures preserve their phase coherence for a long time: phase
relaxation time $\tau_\phi$ can be orders of magnitude longer than the momentum
relaxation time. The large difference in these time scales gives rise to well
known effects of weak localization, such as anomalous magnetoresistance. Among
other interesting characteristics, study of these effects provide quantitative
information on the dephasing rate $1/\tau_\phi$. This parameter is of
fundamental interest: the relation between $\hbar/\tau_\phi$ and the
temperature $T$ (a typical energy scale of an electron) determines how well a
single electron state is defined. We will discuss the basic physical meaning of
$1/\tau_\phi$ in different situations and its difference from the energy
relaxation rate. At low temperatures, the phase relaxation rate is governed by
collisions between electrons. We will review existing theories of dephasing by
these collisions or (which is the same) by electric noise inside the sample. We
also discuss recent experiments on the magnetoresistance of 1D systems: some of
them show saturation of $1/\tau_\phi$ at low temperatures, the other do not. To
resolve this contradiction we discuss dephasing by an external microwave field
and by nonequilibrium electric noise.

they are computationally tractable while both frustrated and disordered. We
first study a mean field model taking the link lengths between points to be
independent random variables. For this model we find perfect agreement with the
results of a replica calculation. Then we study the case where the points to be
matched are placed at random in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. Using the mean
field model as an approximation to the Euclidean case, we show numerically that
the mean field predictions are very accurate even at low dimension, and that
the error due to the approximation is O(1/d^2). Furthermore, it is possible to
improve upon this approximation by including the effects of Euclidean
correlations among k link lengths. Using k=3 (3-link correlations such as the
triangle inequality), the resulting errors in the energy density are already
less than 0.5% at d>=2. However, we argue that the Euclidean model's 1/d series

were shown to present a ""chaotic"" regime at symmetry eta < 0.5, where the
average length of the cycles increases exponentially with system size, and an
oscillatory regime at high symmetry, where the typical length of the cycles is
2. We show, both with analytic arguments and numerically, that there is a sharp
transition, at a critical symmetry $\e_c=0.33$, between a phase where the
typical cycles have length 2 and basins of attraction of vanishing weight and a
phase where the typical cycles are exponentially long with system size, and the
weights of their attraction basins are distributed as in a Random Map with
reversal symmetry. The time-scale after which cycles are reached grows
exponentially with system size $N$, and the exponent vanishes in the symmetric
limit, where $T\propto N^{2/3}$. The transition can be related to the dynamics
of the infinite system (where cycles are never reached), using the closing
probabilities as a tool.
  We also study the relaxation of the function $E(t)=-1/N\sum_i |h_i(t)|$,
where $h_i$ is the local field experienced by the neuron $i$. In the symmetric
system, it plays the role of a Ljapunov function which drives the system
towards its minima through steepest descent. This interpretation survives, even
if only on the average, also for small asymmetry. This acts like an effective
temperature: the larger is the asymmetry, the faster is the relaxation of $E$,
and the higher is the asymptotic value reached. $E$ reachs very deep minima in
the fixed points of the dynamics, which are reached with vanishing probability,
and attains a larger value on the typical attractors, which are cycles of
length 2.

of glassy order and fermionic correlations, which culminates in the
implementation of Parisi replica permutation symmetry breaking (RPSB) in their
T=0 quantum field theories. Precursor effects below fermionic AT-lines become
stronger as the temperature decreases and play a crucial role within the entire
low T regime. The Parisi ultrametric structure is shown to determine low energy
excitations and the dynamic behaviour of fermionic correlations for large
times, which is predicted to affect transport properties in metallic (and
superconducting) spin glasses. Thus we reveal quantum dynamical fingerprints of
the Parisi scheme. These effects, being strongest as T->0, are contrasted with
quantum spin glass transitions at T=0 displaying only small RPSB corrections at
low T. RPSB-effects moreover appear to influence the loci of the ground state
transitions at O(T^0) and hence the phase diagrams. We derive a new
representation of the T=0 Green's function which leads to a map of the
fermionic (insulating) spin glass solution to the local limit solution of a
Hubbard model with a random repulsive interaction. We obtain the distribution
of the Hubbard interaction fluctuation and its dependence on the order of RPSB.
A generalized mapping between metallic spin glass and random U Hubbard model is
conjectured. The new representation of the Green's function at T=0 is suggested
to be useful for generalizations to superconductors with spin glass phases.

the absorption or amplification parameter is large is also quite different from
the RPA result. We prove that the probability densities in the amplifying case

the analysis of the average reflectance that shows a nonmonotonic dependence on

autocorrelation function of the conductance versus magnetic field strength for
ballistic electron transport through few-channel microstructures with the shape
of a classically chaotic billiard coupled to ideal leads. This function depends
on the total number M of channels and the parameter t which measures the
difference in magnetic field strengths. Using the supersymmetry technique, we
calculate for any value of M the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion for
small t. We pay particular attention to the evaluation of the boundary terms.
For small values of M, we supplement this analytical study by a numerical

semiclassical theory and valid for large M. For small M, we present evidence
for non--analytic behavior of the autocorrelation function at t = 0.

microscopic agents are the individual traders and their capital. Their basic
dynamics consists in the auto-catalysis of the individual capital and in the
global competition/cooperation between the agents mediated by the total wealth

such systems lead generically to (truncated) Pareto power-law distribution of

truncation in the Levy distribution to the (truncation in the Pareto Power Law
i.e. to the) fact that at each moment no trader can own more than the current
total wealth invested in the stock. In the cases where the system is dominated
by the largest traders, the dynamics looks similar to noisy low-dimensional
chaos. By introducing traders memory and/or feedback between individual and
collective wealth fluctuations (the later identified with the stock returns),
one obtains clustered ""volatility"" as well as market booms and crashes. The
basic feedback loop consists in: - computing the market price of the stock as
the sum of the individual wealths invested in the stock by the traders and -
determining the time variation of the individual trader wealth as his/her
previous wealth multiplied by the stock return (i.e. the variation of the stock
price).

sequences of transitions take place, causing the solution space to vanish. We
found that the transition from an extended solution space to a shrunk space is
retarded because of the symmetry of the constraints, in contrast to the
analogous problem of pattern storage. For low tolerance, the solution space

systems, which is based on the transfer-matrix formulation of the percolation
problem. It simultaneously incorporates the connective properties reflected in
non-zero matrix elements and allows one to use standard random-matrix
multiplication techniques. Thus it is possible to investigate physical
processes on the percolation structure with the high efficiency and precision
characteristic of transfer-matrix methods, while avoiding disconnections. The
method is illustrated for two-dimensional site percolation by calculating (i)
the critical correlation length along the strip, and the finite-size
longitudinal DC conductivity: (ii) at the percolation threshold, and (iii) very
near the pure-system limit.

mean field predictions. In fact it shares some features typical of models with
full replica-symmetry breaking (FRSB). Nevertheless, we believe that the

The usual Lyapunov exponent is not able to capture the essential features of
this macroscopic phenomenon. Using the recently introduced notion of finite

Lyapunov exponent emerges, which can be much smaller than the former. A
quantitative characterization of the chaotic motion at hydrodynamical level is

and diffuse scattering. The analysis of Bragg diffraction data gives only
information about the average structure of the crystal. The interpretation of
diffuse scattering is in general a more difficult task. A recent approach of
analysing diffuse scattering is based on the Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC)
technique. This method minimises the difference between observed and calculated
diffuse scattering and leads to one real space structure consistent with the
observed diffuse scattering.
  The first example given in this paper demonstrates the viability of the RMC
methods by refining diffuse scattering data from simulated structures showing
known occupational and displacement disorder. As a second example, results of
RMC refinements of the diffuse neutron- and X-ray scattering of stabilised
zirconia (CSZ) are presented. Finally a discussion of the RMC method and an
outlook on further developments of this method is given.

that the model exhibits crossover from the intermediate regime, with effective
scaling exponents for kinetic roughening significantly larger than for the
ordinary single-step growth model, to asymptotic regime with exponents of the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class. Crossover time and length are exponentially
increasing with K. For a given large K, scaling with enhanced exponents is
valid over many decades. The effective scaling exponents are continuously
increasing with K. Surface ordering proceeds up to crossover. Average size of
surface domains increases during growth with the exponent close to 1/2, the
spin-spin correlation function and the distribution of domains obey scaling
with the same exponent.

model are subjected to a multitude of stresses, generated in a hierarchy of
different contexts. The hierarchy is realized as a Cayley-tree. Two different
ways of stress propagation in the tree are considered. In both cases, coherence
arises in large subsystems of the tree. Clear similarities between the behavior
of the tree model and of the coherent-noise model can be observed. For one of
the two methods of stress propagation, the behavior of the tree model can be
approximated very well by an ensemble of coherent-noise models, where the sizes
$k$ of the systems in the ensemble scale as $k^{-2}$. The results are found to
be independent of the tree's structure for a large class of reasonable choices.
Additionally, it is found that power-law distributed lifetimes of agents arise

feel.

semiconductor devices have revealed an unexpected metal-insulator transition
and have challenged the previously held assumption that there is no such
transition in two dimensions. While the experiments are still at the stage of
rapid development, it is becoming evident that they cannot be understood from
the conventional perspective of weak interactions. In the present paper, we
propose the following. (1) The low-density insulating state is the Wigner
Glass, a phase with quasi-long-range translational order and competing
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions. (2) The
transition is the melting of this Wigner Glass, disorder being the agent
allowing the transition to be second order. (3) Within the Wigner Glass phase,
there are at least two, distinct magnetic ground-states, a ferromagnetic state
at very low electron density and a spin-liquid state with a spin pseudo-gap at
higher densities. (4) The metallic side of the transition is a non-Fermi
liquid. These conclusions are encapsulated in Figure 1 which presents the
proposed phase diagram as a function of disorder strength and density; we also
suggest experimental signatures of the various phases and transitions.

framework, the local pairing amplitude develops a broad distribution with

density of states continues to show a finite spectral gap. The persistence of
the spectral gap at large disorder is shown to arise from the break up of the

reviewed, with special emphasis on systems consisting of coupled chaotic
elements. In many situations it is observed that the uncoupled elements when
driven by identical noise, show synchronization phenomena where chaotic
trajectories exponentially converge towards a single noisy trajectory,
independent of the initial conditions. In a random neural network, with
infinite range coupling, chaos is suppressed due to noise and the system
evolves towards a fixed point. Spatiotemporal stochastic resonance phenomenon
has been observed in a square array of coupled threshold devices where a
temporal characteristic of the system resonates at a given noise strength. In a
chaotically evolving coupled map lattice with logistic map as local dynamics
and driven by identical noise at each site, we report that the number of
structures (a structure is a group of neighbouring lattice sites for whom
values of the variable follow certain predefined pattern) follow a power-law
decay with the length of the structure. An interesting phenomenon, which we
call stochastic coherence, is also reported in which the abundance and
lifetimes of these structures show characteristic peaks at some intermediate
noise strength.

molecular dynamics simulations in two and three dimensions in quiescent and
sheared conditions.We may define bonds between neighboring particle pairs
unambiguously owing to the sharpness of the first peak of the pair correlation
functions. Upon structural rearrangements, they break collectively in the form
of clusters whose sizes grow with lowering the temperature $T$. The bond life
time $\tau_b$, which depends on $T$ and the shear rate $\gdot$, is on the order
of the usual structural or $\alpha$ relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ in weak
shear $\gdot \tau_{\alpha} \ll 1$, while it decreases as $1/\gdot$ in strong
shear $\gdot\tau_{\alpha} \gg 1$ due to shear-induced cage breakage.
Accumulated broken bonds in a time interval ($\sim 0.05\tau_b$) closely
resemble the critical fluctuations of Ising spin systems. For example, their
structure factor is well fitted to the Ornstein-Zernike form, which yields the
correlation length $\xi$ representing the maximum size of the clusters composed
of broken bonds. We also find a dynamical scaling relation, $\tau_b \sim
\xi^{z}$, valid for any $T$ and $\gdot$ with $z=4$ in two dimensions and $z=2$
in three dimensions. The viscosity is of order $\tau_b$ for any $T$ and
$\gdot$, so marked shear-thinning behavior emerges. The shear stress is close
to a limiting stress in a wide shear region. We also examine motion of tagged
particles in shear in three dimensions. The diffusion constant is found to be
of order $\tau_b^{-\nu}$ with $\nu=0.75 \sim 0.8$ for any $T$ and $\gdot$, so
it is much enhanced in strong shear compared with its value at zero shear. This
indicates breakdown of the Einstein-Stokes relation in accord with experiments.
Some possible experiments are also proposed.

  space-restricted lattices","  The problem of the one-exciton absorption spectrum is considered for the
lattice of two-level interacting atoms whose initial energy splitting depends
on the coordinate. It is shown that for some types of interatomic interaction,
this problem can be reduced to a differential equation of Schrodinger type,
which, in some cases, can be solved in closed form. By way of example, problems
on the one dimensional chain having an initial splitting jump and on the
spherical cluster are solved. In both cases analitical solutions are obtained,
which considerably reduce the time required for calculations of one-dimensional
systems and permit the calculation of three-dimensional spherical clusters,
whereas the numerical calculation becomes impossible for the clusters with a
radius larger than ten lattice constants. The spectra calculated for small
systems completely coincide with the spectra obtained by means of numerical
diagonalization. The proposed method may appear to be convinient for solving
problems related to Frenkel excitons in systems having no translation symmetry
(disordered systems).

of metals deposited onto substrates held at liquid helium temperatures. The
resistance at the crossover is well defined by the onset of a nearly linear
dependence of conductance on thickness at fixed temperature in a sequence of in

intricate network of synaptic connections that are generated during the system

embryonic environment to their targets using chemical communication. A major
obstacle in the elucidation of fundamental principles underlying this
self-wiring is the complexity of the system being analyzed. Hence much effort
is devoted to in-vitro experiments of simpler 2D model systems. In these
experiments neurons are placed on Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) surfaces so it is easier
to monitor their self-wiring. We developed a model to reproduce the salient
features of the 2D systems, inspired by the study of bacterial colony's growth
and the aggregation of amoebae. We represent the neurons (each composed of
cell's soma, neurites and growth cones) by active elements that capture the
generic features of the real neurons. The model also incorporates stationary
units representing the cells' soma and communicating walkers representing the
growth cones. The stationary units send neurites one at a time, and respond to
chemical signaling. The walkers migrate in response to chemotaxis substances
emitted by the soma and communicate with each other and with the soma by means
of chemotactic ``feedback''. The interplay between the chemo-repulsive and
chemo-attractive responses is determined by the dynamics of the walker's
internal energy which is controlled by the soma. These features enable the
neurons to perform the complex task of self-wiring.

  colonies","  We study the effect of discreteness on various models for patterning in
bacterial colonies. In a bacterial colony with branching pattern, there are
discrete entities - bacteria - which are only two orders of magnitude smaller
than the elements of the macroscopic pattern. We present two types of models.
The first is the Communicating Walkers model, a hybrid model composed of both
continuous fields and discrete entities - walkers, which are coarse-graining of
the bacteria. Models of the second type are systems of reaction diffusion
equations, where the branching of the pattern is due to non-constant diffusion
coefficient of the bacterial field. The diffusion coefficient represents the
effect of self-generated lubrication fluid on the bacterial movement. We
implement the discreteness of the biological system by introducing a cutoff in
the growth term at low bacterial densities. We demonstrate that the cutoff does
not improve the models in any way. Its only effect is to decrease the effective
surface tension of the front, making it more sensitive to anisotropy. We
compare the models by introducing food chemotaxis and repulsive chemotactic
signaling into the models. We find that the growth dynamics of the
Communication Walkers model and the growth dynamics of the Non-Linear diffusion
model are affected in the same manner. From such similarities and from the
insensitivity of the Communication Walkers model to implicit anisotropy we
conclude that the increased discreteness, introduced be the coarse-graining of
the walkers, is small enough to be neglected.

  disordered binary alloys in the Quantum Site Percolation limit","  Electronic properties of disordered binary alloys are studied via the
calculation of the average Density of States (DOS) in two and three dimensions.
We propose a new approximate scheme that allows for the inclusion of local
order effects in finite geometries and extrapolates the behavior of infinite
systems following `finite-size scaling' ideas. We particularly investigate the
limit of the Quantum Site Percolation regime described by a tight-binding
Hamiltonian. This limit was chosen to probe the role of short range order (SRO)
properties under extreme conditions. The method is numerically highly efficient
and asymptotically exact in important limits, predicting the correct DOS
structure as a function of the SRO parameters. Magnetic field effects can also
be included in our model to study the interplay of local order and the shifted
quantum interference driven by the field. The average DOS is highly sensitive
to changes in the SRO properties, and striking effects are observed when a
magnetic field is applied near the segregated regime. The new effects observed
are twofold: there is a reduction of the band width and the formation of a gap
in the middle of the band, both as a consequence of destructive interference of
electronic paths and the loss of coherence for particular values of the
magnetic field. The above phenomena are periodic in the magnetic flux. For
other limits that imply strong localization, the magnetic field produces minor
changes in the structure of the average DOS.

  models","  A picture for thermodynamics of the glassy state was introduced recently by
us (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79} (1997) 1317; {\bf 80} (1998) 5580). It starts by
assuming that one extra parameter, the effective temperature, is needed to
describe the glassy state. This approach connects responses of macroscopic
observables to a field change with their temporal fluctuations, and with the
fluctuation-dissipation relation, in a generalized, non-equilibrium way.
Similar universal relations do not hold between energy fluctuations and the
specific heat.
  In the present paper the underlying arguments are discussed in greater
length. The main part of the paper involves details of the exact dynamical
solution of two simple models introduced recently: uncoupled harmonic
oscillators subject to parallel Monte Carlo dynamics, and independent spherical
spins in a random field with such dynamics. At low temperature the relaxation
time of both models diverges as an Arrhenius law, which causes glassy behavior
in typical situations. In the glassy regime we are able to verify the above
mentioned relations for the thermodynamics of the glassy state.
  In the course of the analysis it is argued that stretched exponential
behavior is not a fundamental property of the glassy state, though it may be
useful for fitting in a limited parameter regime.

relatively active regions dominantly contribute to the mean square
displacement, giving rise to a diffusion constant systematically larger than

hysteresis for uniaxial (scalar) spins, is extended to the case of a
multicomponent (vector) field. From symmetry arguments and a perturbative
renormalization group approach (in the path integral formalism), it is found
that the generic behavior at long time and length scales is described by the
scalar fixed point (reached for a given value of the magnetic field and of the
quenched disorder), with the corresponding Ising-like exponents. By tuning an
additional parameter, however, a fully rotationally invariant fixed point can
be reached, at which all components become critical simultaneously, with
O(n)-like exponents. Furthermore, the possibility of a spontaneous
non-equilibrium transverse ordering, controlled by a distinct fixed point, is
unveiled and the associated exponents calculated. In addition to these central
results, a didactic ``derivation'' of the equations of motion for the spin
field are given, the scalar model is revisited and treated in a more direct
fashion, and some issues pertaining to time dependences and the problem of
multiple solutions within the path integral formalism are clarified.

progressively stored in the crust until a threshold is reached at which it is
suddenly released in an earthquake. We review three important paradoxes, the
strain paradox, the stress paradox and the heat flow paradox, that are
difficult to account for in this picture, either individually or when taken
together. Resolutions of these paradoxes usually call for additional
assumptions on the nature of the rupture process (such as novel modes of
deformations and ruptures) prior to and/or during an earthquake, on the nature
of the fault and on the effect of trapped fluids within the crust at
seismogenic depths. We review the evidence for the essential importance of
water and its interaction with the modes of deformations. Water is usually seen
to have mainly the mechanical effect of decreasing the normal lithostatic
stress in the fault core on one hand and to weaken rock materials via
hydrolytic weakening and stress corrosion on the other hand. We also review the
evidences that water plays a major role in the alteration of minerals subjected
to finite strains into other structures in out-of-equilibrium conditions. This
suggests novel exciting routes to understand what is an earthquake, that
requires to develop a truly multidisciplinary approach involving mineral
chemistry, geology, rupture mechanics and statistical physics.

affected by the fronts, and they exhibit normal scaling. The crossover
behaviour of all these quantities between the ballistic and the localised
regime is described by scaling functions of one single variable, $x=t/\xi_0$.
These predictions are confirmed by accurate numerical data, both in the normal
and in the anomalous case.

priori information is hereby decomposed into simple components represented by
quadratic building blocks (quadratic concepts) which are then combined by
conjunctions and disjunctions to built more complex, problem specific error
functionals. While conjunction of quadratic concepts leads to classical
quadratic regularization functionals, disjunctions, representing ambiguous
priors, result in non--convex error functionals. These go beyond classical
quadratic regularization approaches and correspond, in Bayesian interpretation,
to non--gaussian processes. Numerical examples show that the resulting

existing theory of the transport properties of disordered conductors in the
so-called weak localization regime. In particular, we demonstrate explicitly
that recent attempts to justify theoretically that the dephasing rate
(extracted from the magnetoresistance) remains finite at zero temperature are
based on the profoundly incorrect calculation. This demonstration is based on a
straightforward evaluation of the effect of the electron-electron interaction
on the weak localization correction to the conductivity of disordered metals.
Using well-controlled perturbation theory with the inverse conductance $g$ as
the small parameter, we show that this effect consists of two contributions.
First contribution comes from the processes with energy transfer smaller than
the temperature. This contribution is responsible for setting the energy scale
for the magnetoresistance. The second contribution originates from the virtual
processes with energy transfer larger than the temperature. It is shown that
the latter processes have nothing to do with the dephasing, but rather manifest
the second order (in $1/g$) correction to the conductance. This correction is
calculated for the first time. The paper also contains a brief review of the
existing experiments on the dephasing of electrons in disordered conductors and
an extended qualitative discussion of the quantum corrections to the
conductivity and to the density of electronic states in the weak localization
regime.

long-range attractive potential is studied. For low energy density $U$ a
collapsed phase is identified, while in the high energy limit the particles are
homogeneously distributed. A phase transition from the collapsed to the
homogeneous state occurs at critical energy U_c. A theoretical analysis within
the canonical ensemble identifies such a transition as first order. But
microcanonical simulations reveal a negative specific heat regime near $U_c$.
The dynamical behaviour of the system is affected by this transition : below
U_c anomalous diffusion is observed, while for U > U_c the motion of the
particles is almost ballistic. In the collapsed phase, finite $N$-effects act
like a noise source of variance O(1/N), that restores normal diffusion on a
time scale diverging with N. As a consequence, the asymptotic diffusion
coefficient will also diverge algebraically with N and superdiffusion will be
observable at any time in the limit N \to \infty. A Lyapunov analysis reveals
that for U > U_c the maximal exponent \lambda decreases proportionally to
N^{-1/3} and vanishes in the mean-field limit. For sufficiently small energy,
in spite of a clear non ergodicity of the system, a common scaling law \lambda
\propto U^{1/2} is observed for any initial conditions.

This allows us to determine the effective height of free energy barriers that
separate a glassy minimum from the others. The dependence of the height of free
energy barriers on the density is investigated in detail. The general
appearance of the free energy landscape resembles that of a putting green:
relatively deep minima separated by a fairly flat structure. We discuss the

  in granular gold film","  The low temperature (0.5-55 K) conduction of semicontinuous gold film vacuum
deposited at T \approx 50 K is studied. The film is near the percolation
threshold (thickness 3.25 nm). Its resistance is extremely sensitive to the
applied voltage U. At low enough U the film behaves as an insulator
(two-dimensional granular metal). In this state the dependences R(T) \propto
\exp (1/T) (for T \leq 20 K) and R(U) \propto \exp (1/U)) (for T \leq 1 K and U
> 0.1 V) are observed. Magnetoresistance (MR) is negative and can be described
by \Delta R(H)/R(0) \propto -H^2/T. This negative MR which manifests itself for
nearest-neighbour hopping is rather uncommon and, up to now, has not been
clarified. The possible mechanisms of such case of negative MR are discussed.

  the Human Brain","  The neural networks of the human brain act as very efficient parallel
processing computers co-ordinating memory related responses to a multitude of
input signals from sensory organs. Information storage, update and appropriate
retrieval are controlled at the molecular level by the neuronal cytoskeleton
which serves as the internal communication network within neurons. Information
flow in the highly ordered parallel networks of the filamentous protein
polymers which make up the cytoskeleton may be compared to atmospheric flows
which exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations, i.e. long-term memory.
Such long-range spatiotemporal correlations are ubiquitous to real world
dynamical systems and is recently identified as signature of self-organized
criticality or chaos. The signatures of self-organized criticality i.e.
long-range temporal correlations have recently been identified in the
electrical activity of the brain. A recently developed non-deterministic cell
dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed long-range
spatiotemporal correlations as intrinsic to quantum-like mechanics governing
flow dynamics. The model visualises large scale circulations to form as the
result of spatial integration of enclosed small scale perturbations with
intrinsic two-way ordered energy flow between the scales. Such a concept maybe
applied for the collection and integration of a multitude of signals at the
cytoskeletal level and manifested in activation of neurons in the macroscale.
The cytoskeleton networks inside neurons may be the elementary units of a
unified dynamic memory circulation network with intrinsic global response to
local stimuli.

view of the replica theory. The consideration is done in terms of the usual
random temperature Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian in space dimensions $D < 4$ in
the zero external magnetic field. It is shown that in the paramagnetic phase,
at temperatures not too close to $T_{c}$ (where the behaviour of the pure
system is correctly described by the Gaussian approximation), the free energy
of the system has additional non-perturbative contribution of the form
$\exp{-(const) \frac{\tau^{(4-D)/2}}{u}}$ (where $\tau = (T-T_{c})/T_{c}$),
which has essential singularity in the parameter $u \to 0$ which describes the
strength of the disorder. It is demonstrated that this contribution appears due
to non-linear localized (instanton-like) solutions of the mean-field stationary
equations which are characterized by the special type of the replica symmetry
breaking . It is argued that physically these replica instantons describe the
contribution from rare spatial ""ferromagnetic islands"" in which local (random)

In order to investigate the suggested power-law localization of states, we

Boltzmann-Langevin equation approach we reduce the calculation of shot-noise
correlators to the solution of diffusion equations. Within this approach we
prove the universality of shot-noise in multiterminal diffusive conductors of
arbitrary shape and dimension for purely elastic scattering as well as for hot
electrons. We show that shot-noise in multiterminal conductors is a non-local
quantity and that exchange effects can occur in the absence of quantum phase
coherence even at zero electron temperature. It is also shown that the exchange
effect measured in one contact is always negative -- in agreement with the
Pauli principle. We discuss a new phenomenon in which current noise is induced
by thermal transport. We propose a possible experiment to measure locally the
effective noise temperature. Concrete numbers for shot-noise are given that can
be tested experimentally.

some of the advantages and drawbacks of computer simulations of such systems.
Subsequently we present the results of computer simulations in which the
dynamics of a fragile glass former, a binary Lennard-Jones system, is compared
to the one of a strong glass former, SiO_2. This comparison gives evidence that
the reason for the different temperature dependence of these two types of glass
formers lies in the transport mechanism for the particles in the vicinity of
T_c, the critical temperature of mode-coupling theory. Whereas the one of the
fragile glass former is described very well by the ideal version of
mode-coupling theory, the one for the strong glass former is dominated by
activated processes. In the last part of the article we review some simulations
of glass formers in which the dynamics below the glass transition temperature
was investigated. We show that such simulations might help to establish a
connection between systems with self generated disorder (e.g. structural
glasses) and quenched disorder (e.g. spin glasses).

  Scaling, a Cavity Solution, and Configuration Space properties","  The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Problem asks for the longest sequence of
(non-contiguous) matches between two given strings of characters. Using
extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find a finite size scaling law of the
form E(L)/N =C + A/(N^1/2 ln N)+... for the mean LCS length of two random
strings of size N over S letters. We provide precise estimates of C for S
between 2 and 15. We consider also a related Bernoulli Matching model where the
different entries of an N times M array are independently occupied with
probability 1/S. In that case we find the expression of the limit of L(N,M)/N
as N grows to infinity, as a function of r=M/N. This expression provides a very
good approximation for the Random String model, which gets more and more
accurate as S increases. The question of the ``universality class'' of the LCS
problem is also considered. For the Bernoulli Matching model we find very good
agreement with recent scaling predictions of Hwa and Lassig for
Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment. We find however that the variance of the
LCS length has a different scaling different in the Random String model,
suggesting that long-ranged correlations among the matches are relevant in this
model. We finally study the ``ground state'' properties of this problem. We
find in particular that the number of solutions typically grows exponentially
with N, i.e. this system has a residual entropy at T=0. Also the overlap
between two LCSs chosen at random is found to be self averaging and to aproach
a definite value q(S)<1 as N grows.

calculations for hard spheres. For wave-vectors larger than the maximum of the

> \lambda_2(0)$ for not too large $U$ and test the validity of various proposed
fit functions for $\lambda_2(U)$. Finite-size scaling allows us to obtain
infinite sample size estimates $\xi_{2}(U)$ and we find that $ \xi_{2}(U) \sim
\xi_2(0)^{\alpha(U)} $ with $\alpha(U)$ varying between $\alpha(0)\approx 1$
and $\alpha(1) \approx 1.5$. We observe that all $\xi_2(U)$ data can be made to
coalesce onto a single scaling curve. We also present results for the problem
of TIP in two different random potentials corresponding to interacting
electron-hole pairs.

glass at a temperature where, in equilibrium, there are presumed to be (two or

time goes to infinity, although the system is usually in some pure state
locally, either it never settles permanently on a fixed lengthscale into a
single pure state, or it does but then the pure state depends on both the
initial spin configuration and the realization of the stochastic dynamics. But
this latter case can occur only if there exists an uncountable number of pure
states (for each coupling realization) with almost every pair having zero
overlap. In both cases, almost no initial spin configuration is in the basin of
attraction of a single pure state; that is, the configuration space (resulting
from a deep quench) is all boundary (except for a set of measure zero). We
prove that the former case holds for deeply quenched two-dimensional
ferromagnets. Our results raise the possibility that even if more than one pure

melts are studied by computer simulation: the bond-fluctuation model on a
simple cubic lattice, where a bond-length potential favors long bonds, is
treated by dynamic Monte Carlo methods, and a bead-spring model in the
continuum with a Lennard-Jones potential between the beads is treated by
Molecular Dynamics. While the dynamics of both models differ for short length
scales and associated time scales, on mesoscopic spatial and temporal scales
both models behave similarly. In particular, the mode coupling theory of the
glass transition can be used to interpret the slowing down of the undercooled
polymer melt. For the off-lattice model, the approach to the critical point of
mode coupling is both studied for constant pressure and for constant volume.
The lattice model allows a test of the Gibbs-Di Marzio entropy theory of the
glass transition, and our finding is that although the entropy does decrease
significantly, there is no ``entropy catastrophe'', where the fluid entropy
would turn negative. Finally, an outlook on confinement effects on the glass
transition in thin film geometry is given.

``intrinsic profiles'' centered around a two dimensional surface, the ``local
interface position'', is tested by extensive Monte Carlo simulations of
interfaces between demixed homopolymer phases in symmetric binary (AB)
homopolymer blends, using the bond fluctuation model. The simulations are done
in an LxLxD geometry. The interface is forced to run parallel to the LxL planes
by imposing periodic boundary conditions in these directions and fixed boundary
conditions in the D direction, with one side favoring A and the other side
favoring B. Intrinsic profiles are calculated as a function of the ``coarse
graining length'' B by splitting the system into columns of size BxBxD and
averaging in each column over profiles relative to the local interface
position. The results are compared to predictions of the self-consistent field
theory. It is shown that the coarse graining length can be chosen such that the
interfacial width matches that of the self-consistent field profiles, and that
for this choice of B the ``intrinsic'' profiles compare well with the
theoretical predictions.

  Protein Models","  Background: Designing amino acid sequences that are stable in a given target
structure amounts to maximizing a conditional probability. A straightforward
approach to accomplish this is a nested Monte Carlo where the conformation
space is explored over and over again for different fixed sequences, which
requires excessive computational demand. Several approximate attempts to remedy
this situation, based on energy minimization for fixed structure or high-$T$
expansions, have been proposed. These methods are fast but often not accurate
since folding occurs at low $T$.
  Results: We develop a multisequence Monte Carlo procedure, where both
sequence and conformation space are simultaneously probed with efficient
prescriptions for pruning sequence space. The method is explored on
hydrophobic/polar models. We first discuss short lattice chains, in order to
compare with exact data and with other methods. The method is then successfully
applied to lattice chains with up to 50 monomers, and to off-lattice 20-mers.
  Conclusions: The multisequence Monte Carlo method offers a new approach to
sequence design in coarse-grained models. It is much more efficient than
previous Monte Carlo methods, and is, as it stands, applicable to a fairly wide
range of two-letter models.

periodic boundary conditions in both directions are calculated for sizes up to
40^2. A combination of a genetic algorithm and Cluster-Exact Approximation is
used. For each quenched realization of the bonds up to 40 independent ground
states are obtained.
  For the infinite system a ground-state energy of e=-1.4015(3) is
extrapolated. The ground-state landscape is investigated using a finite-size
scaling analysis of the distribution of overlaps. The mean-field picture
assuming a complex landscape describes the situation better than the
droplet-scaling model, where for the infinite system mainly two ground states
exist. Strong evidence is found that the ground states are not organized in an
ultrametric fashion in contrast to previous results for three-dimensional spin
glasses.

interactions in the gapless phase of coupled Hubbard chains, using a
renormalization group technique. For non-interacting electrons, we obtained the
localization length proportional to the number of chains, as already shown in
the other approaches. For interacting electrons, the localization length is
longer for stronger interactions, that is, the interactions counteract the
random potentials. Accordingly, the localization length is not a simple linear
function of the number of chains. This interaction effect is strongest when
there is only a single chain. We also calculate the effects of interactions and
random potentials on charge stiffness.

gravity in two-dimensions. An investigation of the microscopic grain dynamics
reveals that grains remain separated but with a power-law distribution of
distances and times between collisions.
  While there are large random grain velocities, many of these fluctuations are
correlated across the system and local rearrangements are very slow. Stresses
in the system are almost entirely transfered by collisions and the structure of
the stress tensor comes almost entirely from a bias in the directions in which
collisions occur.

in the presence of random impurity scattering can play an important role in the
thermal stabilization of amorphous Hume-Rothery systems: When there is strong
backscattering off local, concentrical ion clusters, the static electron
density response $\chi (0,q)$ acquires a powerlaw divergence at $q=2k_F$ even
at elevated temperature. This leads to an enhancement as well as to a
systematical phase shift of the Friedel oscillations, both consistent with
experiments. The possible importance of this effect in icosahedral
quasicrystals is discussed.

correlations of a passive scalar advected by a random velocity field, with
random forcing and finite molecular diffusivity kappa. The method, which is
here presented in detail, is particularly well suited for studying the kappa
tending to 0 limit when the velocity field is not smooth. Efficient Monte Carlo
simulations based on this method are applied to the Kraichnan model of passive
scalar and lead to accurate determinations of the anomalous intermittency
corrections in the fourth-order structure function as a function of the scaling
exponent xi of the velocity field in two and three dimensions. Anomalous
corrections are found to vanish in the limits xi tending to 0 and xi tending to
2, as predicted by perturbation theory.

external load is introduced and numerically simulated. The stress is
stochastically transferred from higher layers to lower ones. Cracked areas
exhibit various morphologies, depending on the degree of randomness in the
packing and on the ductility of the grains. The external force necessary to
continue the cracking process is constant in wide range of values of the
fraction of already cracked grains. If the grains are very brittle, the force
fluctuations become periodic in early stages of cracking. Distribution of
cracking avalanches obeys a power law with exponent $\tau = 2.4 \pm 0.1$.
